Humility is not about thinking less of yourself, rather, humility is thinking about yourself less.


There are many people that have earned my gratitude for their contribution to my
time in graduate school. 

I want to thank my supervisor Prof. Yuichi Kubota, who gave me countless failure-tolerant opportunities
throughout my PhD. Before I knew him, the fear of failure always did paralyzed me, not anymore.

\textit{So I would claim you are profoundly misled by thinking about physics as similar to logic or number theory. It’s not! it’s dynamical evolution, and most results of physics problems are not nice numbers like 1 or $\pi$ or even $e^{\pi}$.}
