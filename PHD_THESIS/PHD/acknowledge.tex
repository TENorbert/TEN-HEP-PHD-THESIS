\textbf{ My younger brother, Adolf Bessem Dikonge, died on the 26th July, 2015 at the age of 24 years.
For some reason, I have no idea where I am pulling the strength to get done with writing this thesis while at the same time making arrangements for his burial on the 22nd of August, 2015. How in the world am I pulling this off? }

There are many people that have earned my gratitude for their contribution to my
time in graduate school. 

I want to thank my supervisor Prof. Yuichi Kubota, who gave me countless failure-tolerant opportunities
throughout my PhD. Before I knew him, the fear of failure always did paralyzed me, not anymore.

\textit{So I would claim you are profoundly misled by thinking about physics as similar to logic or number theory. It’s not! it’s dynamical evolution, and most results of physics problems are not nice numbers like 1 or $\pi$ or even $e^{\pi}$.}
