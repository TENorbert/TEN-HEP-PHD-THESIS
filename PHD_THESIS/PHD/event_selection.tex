The GMSB model is the leading model we have used as providing the signal topology in our search for NMLLP. As a result, we provide an interpretation of our above results in the context of GMSB.
In GMSB, the neutralino $\tilde{\chi^{0}_{1}}$ is the NLSP and decays to the
gravitino $\tilde{G}$ the LSP( as a result of R-parity conservation) in association with a very energetic photon $\gamma$. Because of the smallness in mass difference between the  $\tilde{\chi^{0}_{1}}$ and the $\tilde{G}$ as well as the coupling, the $\tilde{\chi^{0}_{1}}$ decay to $\tilde{G}$ is delayed and as a result, the photon emitted can arrive late in the calorimeter crystals.  Measuring the arrival time of the photon on ECAL crystals, we can extract important parameters of  theory of GMSB.
