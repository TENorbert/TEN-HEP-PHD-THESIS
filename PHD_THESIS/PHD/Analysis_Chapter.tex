\chapter{Search Analysis for Long-Lived Particles }
\section{Analysis Strategy}\label{Analysis}
This analysis is about the search for events with at least a single late arrival time photon at the Electromagnetic Calorimeter~(ECAL) and  large missing transverse energy~(\MET). It uses a counting method where an excess in the number of events with photon time above a defined ECAL timing threshold, to the expected number of events from background processes, indicates the presence of a new physics phenomena.
\newline
Because the decay of a massive long-lived neutral particle into a late photon and large \MET is not common with standard model interactions, we expect most of our background events of this search to arise from  non-collision rather than proton-proton collision events.
\par
We simulate a typical signal event of the decay of a massive neutral long-lived particle, produced in a  proton-proton~($pp$) collision at the LHC and detected with the CMS detector, according to the prediction of a benchmark Gauge Mediating Supersymmetry Breaking~(GMSB) model described as the "Snowmass Points and Slope 8"~(SPS8). In this model, the massive long-lived neutral particle is the Next-to-Lightest Supersymmetric Particle~(NLSP) which is the lightest neutralino~(\PSneutralinoOne). The \PSneutralinoOne decay into a photon~(\Pphoton) and the Lightest Supersymmetric Particle~(LSP) called the gravitino~($\tilde{G}~$),  $\PSneutralinoOne\rightarrow\Pphoton + \tilde{G}$. The $ \tilde{G}$  is undetected because it does not interacts with the CMS detector material. Its presence is indirectly inferred by measuring the missing transverse momentum~(\MET). The photon, because of the long-lived nature of the \PSneutralinoOne, arrives late at the ECAL compared to photons produced from nominal $pp$ collisions. 
\par
In a particle collider, the \PSneutralinoOne can be produced in pair or single in direct interaction of the quarks and gluons~(partons) inside the proton, $\Pquark\APquark\rightarrow \PSneutralinoOne\PSneutralinoOne$, however, in this analysis, we are interested in the scenario where the \PSneutralinoOne is produced indirectly; from the cascade decay of heavier sypersymmetric particles like gluinos and squarks. This is because the gluino/squark production cross-section is largest at a $pp$ collider like the LHC and in association with the neutralino decay, the event also contain multiple hiph-\pt jets which provide an added signal requirement useful for reducing our background events. Thus, a typical signal event at the CMS detector should comprise of a delayed high-\pt photon, large \MET and multiple high-\pt jets. Observing such an event will be evidence of a new physics phenomena.  
%\par 
%Non-collision events with photons from cosmic, \textit{beam halo} muons and \textit{spikes} can also have large ECAL time measurements. $pp$ collision events with \PW, \PZ, multiple jets and $\gamma +$jet(s) where the electron or jet is misidentified as a photon and its arrival time mismeasured, can also give rise to large ECAL time photons. And if these events happen to have \MET due to finite detector resolution(\ie instrumental \MET), it is possible for them to be misidentified as the decay of a long-lived neutral particle. We refer to these kinds of events as background events.
%\par 
%To estimate the background contamination to signal, we  use a data driven approach where we divide our data sample using ECAL time, jet multiplicity and \MET into different control regions~(CRs). After rejecting events with spikes, cosmic and beam halo muons, we employ an \textsf{ABCD} background estimation method to estimate background events contributing to the signal region. 
%\newline 
%Our analysis approach is to count the number events with late photon(s) from proton-proton collision we observed compared to the number of background events we expected.
%Events containing \textit{spikes} produced when particles like high \pt neutrons by-pass the $\pb$ crystals and hit directly the photo-detectors~(APDs) is also a source of isolated early and also late arrival photons. Although  ECAL time measurements of most spikes show they are isolated and have high \pt, with arrival time much earlier compared to "\textit{normal}" photons produced at the nominal proton-proton interaction region whose calibrated average arrival time at ECAL is 0~ns. These different sources of background make it challenging to distinguish a possible signal photon from these separate background photons.
%\newline 
%Together with photons produced from non-collision, events from $pp$ collisions with misreconstucted ECAL time can equally contribute to the tails of the photon time distribution.
% can mimic the signal of an isolated late photon, with large \MET and multiple jets. In the case where the \PW decay into and electron and neutrino, the electron or jet is mis-identified as a photon and its ECAL time miss-measured during event reconstruction, while the undetected photon is identified as \MET. Events where the \PZ boson decays into neutrinos, have large \MET and if the associated jet(s) is mis-identified as photons and their ECAL time mis-measured, such events could mimic signal events with late photons.
\subsubsection*{Signal and Background Events}
A signal event, as previously mentioned, must have at least one high-\pt delayed photon, a number of high-\pt jets and large missing transverse momentum(\MET).
%of the neutralino decay, $\PSneutralinoOne \rightarrow \Pphoton + \tilde{G} $, 
%possible new physics parameter space used for the present physics analysis involves: $\tan(\beta) = 15$, $sign(\mu) = 1$, and $\mathbf{M}_{m} = 2\mathbf{\Lambda}$. While $c\tau$ and $\mathbf{\Lambda}$ are used to scan the available parameter space which maximises the sensitivity of the CMS detector to long-lived particles, in this scenario mostly neutralinos~($\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}$). The cascade decay of higher mass SUSY particles in the SUSY spectrum to $\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}$ allows for signal events with the following constituents:
%\begin{itemize}
While most of our background events are non-collision events like the so-called beam halo, cosmic muons and spikes which can also be the source of events with late photons and large \MET, it is quite possible that events from $pp$ collisions can mimic the neutralino decay signal especially if the ECAL time or \MET is mismeasured. For example, multijets QCD events, inclusive $\PZ + $ jets or $\PW + $ jets events, inclusive top-anti-top~($t\bar{t}) + $ jets events and inclusive $\PZ\PZ$/$\PW\PW$/$\PW\PZ + $ jets events can either have true \MET ; like the events with $\PZ \rightarrow \Pnu\APnu$ and $\PW\rightarrow\Pe\APnue$ decays where the neutrino~(\Pnu) is undetected, or fake \MET~(instrumental \MET); where there is no undetected particle pertaining to the event but rather \MET arising because of poor reconstruction of the energy of particles, as it is with the case for QCD events. The late photon arises when one of the jets or an electron is misidentified as a photon and its time misreconstructed. The other jets in the event satisfy the high-\pt multijets requirement.
\subsection{Signal Modeling}
Our high-energy-physics simulated signal events are produced according to the SPS8 benchmark model using Monte Carlo~(MC) general-purpose event generators. The event generation begins with the production of \textit{SUSY Les Houches Accord}~(SLHA) files using a SUSY software package called \textsf{ISASUSY}, \cite{ISAJET}. The SLHA files contain the the masses, interaction couplings, decay widths, all possible decay channels and branching ratio of every supersymmetric particles. It also contains the fundamental GMSB model parameters
\begin{equation}\label{eq:SUSYPARMS}
\Big\{ \mathbf{\Lambda}, \mathbf{M}_{\mbox{mess}}, \mathbf{N}_{5}, \tan(\beta), sgn(\mu), C_{grav}\Big\} 
\end{equation}
which spans all the possible particle production configurations or phase space defined by the model. In the SPS8 model, the choice of parameters is such that
\begin{equation}\label{eq:SPS8PARM}
sgn(\mu)= 1, \tan(\beta) = 15, \mathbf{N}_{5} = 1, \mathbf{M}_{\mbox{mess}} = 2\mathbf{\Lambda},
\end{equation}
%% 
and $C_{grav}$ and $\mathbf{\Lambda} $ are left free to vary. By varying, respectively, $C_{grav}$ and $\mathbf{\Lambda}$, we can exploit different decay scenarios where the \PSneutralinoOne has a different lifetime and mass. A special software package called \textsf{HDECAY}, is used to handle the decay of all supersymmetric particles including the \PSneutralinoOne decay to photon and gravitino or other particles when possible.
\par
Using the SLHA files as inputs to the MC event generator called \textsf{PYTHIA} \cite{PYTHIA6}, we generate events of supersymetric particles produced at center of mass energy, $\sqrt{S} = 8$\TeV, of the colliding protons. The interaction of these supersymmetric particles with the CMS detector is simulated using the GEANT4 particle detector simulation software \cite{GEANT4}. A full physics event is reconstructed from energy deposits~(hits) in the CMS detector using the CMS Event Reconstruction Software~(CMSSW). To minimize any disagreement between MC and data, we use the same CMSSW release version~(\textbf{CMSSW\_5\_3\_29}) in the MC event reconstruction with the same detector conditions as the recorded data from LHC $pp$ collision.
\par 
The physics process, which we described in detail in section \ref{LHCSUSY}, for the production and decay of \PSneutralinoOne to photon and gravitino  at the LHC $pp$ collisions we studied is 
\begin{equation}
p+p \rightarrow \PSgluino\PSgluino, \PSq\PSq \rightarrow [\mbox{1 or 2 cascade decays}] \rightarrow 2\PSneutralinoOne + \mbox{jets} \rightarrow 2\Pphoton + 2\tilde{G} + \mbox{jets}.
\end{equation}


\subsection{Background Modeling}
Our background study is data-driven for most parts, however, we generate a small sample of  $\gamma +$jet(s) events at leading order cross-sections using \textsf{PYTHIA6} and the detector simulation is done with \textsf{GEANT4}. The reconstructed  $\gamma +$jet(s) events is again performed with the same CMSSW release as the signal MC samples. The $\gamma +$jet(s) MC sample is used for studying ECAL time of simulated events in order to make time adjustment between simulation and data. 
\newline
We did not produced MC samples for background events with \PW, \PZ and $t\bar{t}$ decays because eventhough these events have \MET and multijets, there are not so many cases in which the photon have a  large ECAL time because a jet was misidentified as a photon and its ECAL time mismeasured. Another reason we did not use MC samples of these events is because simulations of photon/electron ECAL time is not very reliable especially for those events with large photon/electron ECAL time. 
One of our event selection requirement is high \pt isolated photons, this should reduce contributions from these collision background events by a lot. 
\newline
We also did not produce MC samples for spikes, cosmic and beam halo muons for the same reason that simulations of photon ECAL time is not very reliable especially for those events with large photon ECAL time. 
\subsection{Datasets}
The data sample used in our analysis was produced during proton-proton collisions of LHC Run 1 in 2012 with the center of mass energy, $\sqrt{S} = 8$~TeV. The CMS detector recorded data equivalent to total integrated luminosity of 19.1~\fbinv .
\paragraph*{Data}\mbox{}\\
We used mostly single photon triggered events from data samples with luminosity sections certified as good. In Table \ref{tab:DATA}, we present these data samples showing their corresponding integrated luminosity. The \textit{jason} file with the list of certified good luminosity sections is
 \textbf{Cert\_8TeVPromptReco\_Colllisions12\_JASON.txt}.

\subsubsection*{Monte Carlo Samples}
The MC samples were produced with \textit{Summer 2012} prescriptions of the calibration and alignment status of the CMS detector and pile up conditions at 8\TeV.
\newline
The GMSB SPS8 signal samples contain 50,000 events for each lifetime and SUSY breaking scale or mass of \PSneutralinoOne. These samples cover \PSneutralinoOne lifetimes, $c\tau_{\PSneutralinoOne}$, from 50 to 1000\cm for each $\mathbf{\Lambda_{m}}$ or \PSneutralinoOne mass~($m_{\PSneutralinoOne}$) point. The SUSY breaking scale, $\mathbf{\Lambda_{m}}$, range is from 100 to 300\TeV equivalent to $m_{\PSneutralinoOne}$ ranging from 139 to 430\GeVcc. These samples are presented in Table \ref{tab:mc_GMSB_sample} showing each cross-section and branching ratio for \PSneutralinoOne decay to $\gamma$ and $\tilde{G}$.
\newline
The $\gamma +$jets MC samples were generated for different momentum of the colliding quarks or gluons inside the protons~(partons) and normalized to the 19.1 \fbinv integrated luminosity. Table \ref{tab:mc_QCD_sample} show the cross-sections, \pt of the parton~($\hat{\pt}$) and the number of events in each sample. A $\hat{\pt}$ range from 50\GeVc to 800\GeVc was scanned.

 Verifying that the GMSB signal samples were correctly generated, we looked at the number of photons, \MET  and number of jets in each MC signal event and also measured the \PSneutralinoOne mean lifetime and compare its value to the theoretical value of \PSneutralinoOne lifetime used in the production of the samples. 
We observed that most of the events had at least a single photon~(left plot) and at least 2 jets~(right plot) as shown in the top plots of Figure \ref{fig:NKINE}. Comparing signal samples for $\Lambda=180$\TeV and $c\tau=2000,4000, 6000$\mm and a MC $\gamma +$ jets with $120 < \hat{\pt} < 170$\GeVc sample, we observed that \MET~(shown in the bottom plot of the same figure) from signal events  was larger than the \MET resulting from energy mismeasurements in events from the $\gamma +$ jets sample as we will expect due to the \PSneutralinoOne decay to gravitino. \newline
By performing a fit analysis to the distribution of the \PSneutralinoOne mean lifetime computed from its transverse distance traveled before decay. This distance is computed using its production vertex and decay vertex.  By comparing the computed value of $c\tau_{\PSneutralinoOne}$ to the value from theoretical prediction supposedly used in the event generation, we are able to validate that each signal MC sample.
These observations confirm qualitatively and quantitatively that our signal samples had been properly generated and indeed most of the signal events had a \PSneutralinoOne which decayed most of the time to a photon and gravitino.

\subsection{ECAL Time}
The presence of spikes, noisy crystals and pile-up events, demand a robust method for measuring the photon arrival time at  ECAL and since ECAL time is our main observable for distinguishing background from signal events, such a method must reduce timing bias which may arise from such anomalous events. As a result, we studied different methods for measuring the photon arrival time at ECAL. 
\newline
The electromagnetic shower of an electromagnetic particle spreads across several crystals~(energy and time measurements from several channels) which belongs to the particle's supercluster containing all of the particle's energy. Using the supercluster, the arrival time of an electromagnetic particle can be defined either using the reconstructed time~($ t_{reco}$) of a single crystal, which is the crystal with the highest energy deposit~(\textit{seed crystal}), or a weighted average time calculated using the reconstructed time of every crystal of the supercluster. We write $t_{seed}$ for the seed time and $t_{Ave}$ for the average time defined as
\begin{equation}{\label{eq:AVETIME}}
t_{Ave} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N\frac{t^{i}_{reco}}{\sigma_{i}^{2}}}{\sum_{i=1}^{N}\frac{1}{\sigma_{i}^{2}}},
\end{equation}
where $N$ is the total number of crystals of the supercluster, $t_{reco,i}$  and $\sigma_{i}$ are the time and uncertainty on the reconstructed time of each channel, respectively. 
%Algorithms for extracting and calibrating ECAL crystals using the reconstructed hit~(\textit{rechit}) time have been developed
%and we describe them in detail in the coming sections.
%We use $t_{reco}$ to denote the reconstructed time of each hit or crystal.
%We will denote the calibrated reconstructed time of an electromagnetic object as, $T_{reco}$. 
%Measuring the difference of the ECAL measured time between any two reconstructed objects~(which can be individual crystals or electromagnetic objects) arriving from the same nominal point, which in principle are both expected to have the same time, gives a reliable measurement of the timing resolution of the sub-detector including the crystal-to-crystal synchronization factor.  In ECAL timing, the photon reconstructed time, $t_{reco}$, can be calculated using either of the following methods:
%%\begin{enumerate}
%%\item \textbf{seed time}: The time of the highest energy crystal or hit in the highest energy basic cluster~(about $9$ crystals) of the photon super cluster~(about $25$ crystals). It is denoted 
%%\item \textbf{Average or mean time}: This is the error weighted average time of all the crystals in the photon seed basic cluster.
%%It is denoted as $t_{Ave}$ or $t_{mean}$.
%%\end{enumerate}
%Therefore, the arrival time of a photon or an electromagnetic object, $t_{\gamma}$ or $t_{\Pepm}$, can either be given as $t_{seed}$ or $t_{Ave}$.
Figure \ref{fig:TIME} shows a comparison of a photon time measured as the seed time, $t_{seed}$, and as the average time, $t_{Ave}$. The distributions have been normalized to total number of events.

\label{fig:TIME}
\end{center}
\end{minipage}

\vspace{5mm}
The spread of both time distributions, $\sigma$ of a Gaussian fit, are very similar. A value of  $\sigma = 345$~ps is observed for seed time compared to $\sigma = 336$~ps for the average time distributions. We used the seed time approach for the photon ECAL time since there is not much to gain from either methods.  \newline
In cases where one or more of the crystals is poorly time calibrated, the photon time from the weighted average time approach is biased. A possible solution for this is to select only properly time calibrated crystals of the supercluster for computing the average time or simply used the times from crystals of the \textit{seed basic cluster}. A supercluster is said to consist of many smaller clusters called \textit{basic clusters}, and the average time of the cluster with the highest energy~(seed basic cluster) can also be used as the particle's measured arrival time.
\paragraph*{}
A $\chi^{2}$ on the photon ECAL time calculated as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:CHI2}
\chi^{2} = \sum^{N}_{i=0}\frac{(t^{i}_{reco} - t_{Ave})^{2}}{\sigma_{i}^{2}}
\end{equation}
where, $N$ is the number of crystals in the photon supercluster, $t^{i}_{reco}$ and $\sigma_{i}$ are the time and uncertainty on the reconstructed time for each crystal and $t_{Ave}$ is the mean time defined in Equation \ref{eq:AVETIME}, is a useful quantity to legitimized the photon time and we use it to distinguish fake photons~(jets misidentified as photons) and especially spikes from true photons. Figure  \ref{fig:spikeVsPhoton} shows the profile of the pulse shape~(left) of an identified spike with that of a true photon event. A distribution of the normalized $\chi^{2}$ against the ECAL time is shown in the right plot of the same figure. Photons with a signal pulse shape profile as that of spikes are associated with large values of $\chi^{2}$ and usually have earlier ECAl arrival time.

 \vspace{5mm}
The plot of $\chi^{2}$ against ECAL time~(left plot of Figure \ref{fig:spikeVsPhoton}) shows that most of the photons have ECAL time around zero but also many of the photons with large ECAL time  have large normalized $\chi^{2}$ values which is expected where the time measurements by non-seeded crystals is inconsistent with the time measurement of the seed crystal. We observed that, with a cut in $\chi^{2} < 4$, we can reduce with 99.2\% efficiency, photon arrival time contributions from spikes and misidentified photon events.

\subsubsection*{Simulated ECAL Time}
It is challenging to properly simulate ECAL time for MC events so that it captures the conditions of the ECAL detector during data recording. This usually leads to time from MC events not representing the exact status of ECAL time as in data in terms of mean time and time resolution.
We adjust the time of MC events to account for any data and MC time difference using selected 1 or 2-jets events from MC $\gamma +$ jet sample. Only events with isolated in-time, $t_{\gamma} < 2$~ns, photon  with $\pt > 80$\GeV are accepted. 
The adjustment is done by shifting the mean time and smearing the resolution by an additional Gaussian convolution on the photon time of MC events so as to match the mean time and time resolution of data. After this adjustment of the MC time, the photon ECAL time from data and MC $\gamma +$ jet sample both shown in Figure \ref{fig:DATAMCTime} comparing before~(left plot) and after~(right plot) the adjustment on MC ECAL time was made, agree quite well. 
%We performed the same smearing for all MC samples used in our analysis.
%\newline
% It is worth noting that the difference of 125~ps between $t^{MC}_{reco}$ and $t^{DATA}_{reco}$ compared to 500~ps ECAL timing resolution is not enough to enormously impact our event selection. %however, simulating photons ECAL time in the tails of the time distribution still remains.

\subsubsection{Neutralino Measured Lifetime}
The distance traveled in the CMS detector by the \PSneutralinoOne before it decays, mentioned previously in the subsection \ref{NeutralinoDecay}, is given as
\begin{equation}{\label{eq:decaylength}}
\mathrm{L} = \left(c\tau_{\PSneutralinoOne}\right) \cdot \left( \gamma \beta\right) = \left(c\tau_{\PSneutralinoOne}\right) \cdot \left( \frac{p}{m_{\PSneutralinoOne}}\right).
\end{equation} 
The momentum~($p$) and mean lifetime~($c\tau_{\PSneutralinoOne}$) of the \PSneutralinoOne determines this distance. Large values of $c\tau_{\PSneutralinoOne}$ means, this distance is large extending even beyond the ECAL volume where detecting the \PSneutralinoOne is not possible while small values of $c\tau_{\PSneutralinoOne}$ means the \PSneutralinoOne decayed early and the photon ECAL arrival time is not large enough and detection using ECAL time measurements only is not very reliable. High \pt also means the \PSneutralinoOne is very boosted and can also travel out of the ECAL before it decays while low momentum means the \PSneutralinoOne is less boosted and traveling slow enough for the photon to be delayed at ECAL. In Figure \ref{fig:NKINE}, we show  distributions of the momentum of the \PSneutralinoOne in the transverse~($x-y$) plane also known as the transverse momentum~( $\pt^{\PSneutralinoOne}$), its transverse distance traveled, transverse momentum of the photon~($\pt^{\Pphoton}$) and photon's estimated arrival time~($T_{\Pphoton}$) at event generation level since we are interested in mostly  events with photon in the barrel region of ECAL. These distributions are for different $\Lambda$ and $c\tau_{\PSneutralinoOne}$ points of the SPS8 model. We observed that, $\pt^{\PSneutralinoOne}$ increases with increase values of $\Lambda$, from $\Lambda = 100$ to 220\TeV,  which agrees with our expectation that, as the value of $\Lambda$ increases, masses of the gluino/squark which cascade decay to the \PSneutralinoOne leading to increase in the momentum of the \PSneutralinoOne. In the same way, increasing values for $\Lambda$ means the \PSneutralinoOne becomes more massive and hence the photon \pt also increases. For a given value of $\Lambda$ or \pt of the nuetralino, the transverse distance traveled by the \PSneutralinoOne before decay~( shown in the top right plot of Figure \ref{fig:NKINE}) and photon expected time at ECAL(shown in the bottom right plot of the same figure) increased with increased value of \PSneutralinoOne mean lifetime, $c\tau = 500$ to $6000$\mm. The qualitative agreement of the distributions of both plots confirms our expectation that the photon is delayed as a result of the long lifetime of the \PSneutralinoOne. However, one can argue that this is not entirely the case as we study in detail the source of delayed photons in the next section.

\subsubsection*{Source of Delayed Photons}
The photon from the decay of \PSneutralinoOne can arrive late at ECAL for either one of the following reasons: because the \PSneutralinoOne is traveling slow \ie with $\beta_{T} = \frac{\pt^{\PSneutralinoOne}}{m_{\PSneutralinoOne}} << 1$, or because the \PSneutralinoOne was produced with significant boost in the transverse direction such that the photon traveled to ECAL through a non-direct flight path from the nominal $pp$ interaction point. We distinguish between these two sources of delayed photons from an estimate of the photon arrival time at ECAL using the  distance traveled by \PSneutralinoOne before decay and photon distance travel from decay point to the point of detection at ECAL. Figure \ref{fig:DELAY}(left) is a schematic diagram showing how we estimate the photon arrival time at ECAL in each of the possible different travel flight path representing the different source of delayed photons. The estimated photon arrival ECAL time for each scenario is given as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item From slow moving neutralinos: $\Delta t_1$ = (L1/c$\beta_{T}$) - (L1/c)
  \item From non-direct traveled flight path: $\Delta t_2$ = (L1 + L2 - L3)/c
  \item ECAL measured time = $\Delta t_{1} + \Delta t_{2}$
\end{itemize}

The \PSneutralinoOne is traveling with velocity $v = c\beta$, where $c$ is the speed of light in vacuum. The distribution of the estimated photon ECAL arrival times $\Delta t_{1}$ and $\Delta t_{2}$, plotted as shown in Figure \ref{fig:DELAY}(right), where the color intensity represents the photon population, shows that most of the late arrival time photons are from the decay of slow moving neutralinos  compared to those arriving late because of their non-direct flight path to ECAL. This proves that a good number of neutralinos produced with low \pt such that the ratio $\frac{\pt}{m_{\tilde{\chi}^{o}_{1}}} << 1$ are very detectable using ECAL time measurements while those with very long lifetimes produced with high \pt will very likely escape the ECAL without detection unless their decay happen within the ECAL volume such that the delayed photon arrives ECAL through a non-direct flight path.
%%%%%
\subsubsection*{Satellite Bunch Time}
We observed~(see Figure \ref{fig:TIMEECAL}) a 2.5~ns discrete pattern in the reconstructed photon arrival time for events, produced in $pp$ collisions, with the photon arriving in the barrel and endcap regions, \ie $|\eta_{\gamma}| < 3.0$, of the ECAL detector and satisfying a photon transverse momentum requirement of $\pt > 50$\GeVc.

\vspace{5mm}
A majority of the photons with this signature are from the endcap~($1.47 < \eta < 3.0$) and not many are from the barrel~($|\eta| < 1.47$) region. Photons with this signature are produced from the  collisions of protons in \textit{Ghost}/\textit{Satellite} bunches, described in  section \ref{Ghost}, with either the main proton collision bunch or other \textit{Ghost}/\textit{Satellite} bunches. We consider events with such photons as background events from collisions contributing as an irreducible source of background to our late photon signal. It is very challenging to reject or estimate the contribution from these background events quantitatively. However, using the ratio of the proton population from the LHC RF cavity proton filling profile of ghost to main proton bunches, we estimate that one in every $10,000$ photons from $pp$ collisions observed in ECAL is from ghosts bunches, with most of the photons from ghost bunches belonging to the endcap regions. Their limited presence in the barrel is because very few of them are produced with high enough \pt to travel to the barrel region. 
\newline
The observation of this phenomenon along with the sub-par ECAL time resolution in the endcaps compared to the barrel, allows us to accept only  photons in the barrel in this analysis.
\newline
Using events with moderate \pt range electromagnetic particles in the barrel such as events with $\PZ \rightarrow \EE$ decay, we studied and estimated the background events contribution from \textit{Ghost}/\textit{Satellite} proton collisions to the late photon signal. The details of this study and the results obtained is discussed in the collision background estimation section of this chapter.

\paragraph*{\MET Adjustments} \mbox{}\\
  The official CMS electromagnetic calorimeter supercluster reconstruction criteria used in the PF event reconstruction algorithm does not include "out-of-time" energy deposits in ECAL. The purpose is to avoid energy deposits not produced from the main proton-proton bunch collisions like machine induced backgrounds. As a result, the photon \et contribution from events with out-of-time photons is not included in the calculation of the event missing transverse energy or \ETslash\hspace{0.15cm}(from now on, we will be using for convenience, \ETslash\hspace{0.15cm} instead of \MET as the symbol for missing transverse energy). This non-inclusion of the out-of-time photon \et, introduces some difference in the calculation of \ETslash\hspace{0.15cm} between in-time~($|t_{\gamma}| < 3.0$~ns) and out-of-time photon events. 
\newline
In our analysis, energy deposits from events with out-of-time photons belong to possible signal events since we are searching for large arrival time photons. Because the out-of-time photon's transverse energy~(\ET) is not included in the sum total transverse momentum for events with out-of-time photons in calculating the total transverse momentum imbalance, we correct for this by adding the out-of-time photon's $\ET$ vector to the  particle flow reconstructed \ETslash\hspace{0.15cm}~(PF-MET) vector. We introduced an additional missing transverse energy variable defined as $\vec{{\ETslash}^{\gamma}\hspace{0.15cm}} = \vec{\ETslash}\hspace{0.25cm} + \vec{\et}$, in our final event selection to avoid any bias is the event selection, particularly for events with out-of-time photons. 
%%The difference between $\ETslash$\hspace{0.25cm} and ${\ETslash}^{\gamma}$ is given as
%%\begin{enumerate}
%%\item ${\ETslash}$~ : PF-MET equal to $\ETslash$\hspace{0.25cm} from standard event reconstruction.
%%\item ${\ETslash}^{\gamma}$~: PF-MET with photon \ET vector subtracted \ie ${\ETslash}^{\gamma} = \ETslash\quad - ~\et$ of the  out-of-time photon.

\section{Event Selection}
Our event selection happens in two stages. The first stage occurs online at the HLT trigger level where only triggered single photon events are selected and the second stage happens offline where the full signal event selection requirement is applied. 
\newline
The full event selection criteria offline is designed to select signal events whose event topology comprise of at least a single photon, multiple jets and large \ETslash\hspace{0.15cm}. The cascade decay of gluino or squark to other quarks/gluons along with the \PSneutralinoOne, is the reason for the multiple jets requirement and the at least a single photon and large \ETslash\hspace{0.15cm} requirement is if at least one of the pair of \PSneutralinoOne decay to a photon and gravitino. The large \ETslash\hspace{0.15cm} requirement is useful for eliminating $\gamma + $jets and QCD events whose \ETslash\hspace{0.15cm} is \textit{fake} \ETslash\hspace{0.15cm}, present because of poor energy reconstruction  while the multijets requirement helps to reduce background events not produced from nominal $pp$ collisions like cosmic muons, beam halo muons and spikes, which usually produce out-of-time photons.
The multiple jets requirement also helps to reduce ElectroWeak~(EWK) background events from $pp$ collisions which are events with the decay of $\PW \rightarrow e + \nu$ and $t\bar{t}$, where the top~($t$) decays to a $b$ quark and a \PW 100\% of the time. These events can produce fake photons~(misidentified electron as a photon) and real \ETslash\hspace{0.15cm} arising from the presence of the neutrino~($\nu$). However, the high-\pt photon requirement in our photon selection certainly reduce the contribution from EWK background events.
\newline 
In order to reduce another source of collision background events which are events with fake photons from multijets and QCD events, where a jet is misidentified as a photon, we require  high-\pt jets of very good quality since jets from multijet QCD events are not of very good quality as a lot of other particles like electrons or muons can be found embedded in these jets.
\newline 
An important part of our photon selection requirement is that we accept only photons in the barrel~($|\eta_{\gamma}| < 1.479$) region of ECAL in order to reduce out-of-time photon background contribution from ghost/satellite bunch collisions. Another out-of-time photon background source are events with spikes and our rejection of these events begin at the HLT trigger level using electromagnetic shower shape selection quantities like $S_{Minor}$ and $S_{Major}$.  
%%%
%%%
\subsection{Trigger Selection}
In our online event selection, we select only events passing our online higher level trigger~(HLT). The HLT trigger used for our event selection during $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{S} = 8$\TeV for this analysis is \texttt{HLT\_DisplacedPhoton65\_CaloIdVL\_IsoL\_PFMET25}, which is 
seeded by level 1 trigger; \texttt{HLT\_L1SingleEG12}. This trigger was developed primarily to study delayed photons and to avoid bias in the event selection towards any particular signal model, the trigger only requires that an accepted event contains at least a single photon with a \pt of at least 65\GeVc and \ETslash\hspace{0.15cm} above 25\GeV. The minor axis of the photon electromagnetic shower must not be spread across many crystals in $\phi$ implemented as $ 0.1 < S_{Minor} < 0.4$. The trigger efficiency and turn-on~(efficiency becomes nearly 100\%) curve for selecting events with delayed photon candidates is studied for the photon \pt and event \ETslash\hspace{0.15cm}. In order to avoid any correlation between the photon and \ETslash\hspace{0.15cm}, the efficiency for each variable is studied separately using another trigger \texttt{HLT\_Photon50\_CaloIdVL\_IsoL}.  The photon candidates used in this photon efficiency study must pass our offline photon selection criteria shown in table \ref{tab:PhotonSel}. The HLT photon selection efficiency for \pt is defined as the fraction of offline reconstructed photons to those triggered by \texttt{HLT\_IsoPhoton50} trigger within $\Delta R < 0.5$.
% We do this by using a \texttt{SingleMuon} dataset~(\texttt{HLT\_IsoMu30}) to study the efficiency measurements.
Similarly, the \ETslash\hspace{0.15cm} HLT efficiency is defined as the fraction of events containing at least a jet and \ETslash\hspace{0.15cm} more than the HLT required \ETslash\hspace{0.15cm} of 25\GeV.
The results of the trigger efficiency measurements are shown in Figure \ref{fig:HLTEff} against photon \pt and \ETslash\hspace{0.15cm}. This HLT event selection efficiency study indicates that the event selection efficiency is 100\% for events with photon $\pt > 80$\GeVc and $\ETslash\hspace{0.15cm} > 60$\GeV. These efficiency studies use the \texttt{HLT\_Photon50\_CaloIdVL\_IsoL} trigger which has no \ETslash\hspace{0.15cm} and jet multiplicity requirement for the denominator and the \texttt{HLT\_DisplacedPhoton65\_CaloIdVL\_IsoL\_PFMET25} for the numerator. A \texttt{SinglePhoton} data sample is used to verify these efficiency study while the GMSB SPS8 and $\gamma +$jets samples are used to derive any correction factors between data and MC events.

\end{center}
\end{minipage}
%%%%
\subsection{Offline Selection}
In addition to the HLT selection, we apply an offline event selection on the photon, jets and \ETslash\hspace{0.15cm} of these events.
\newline
The leading photon of an event must have a \pt  greater than 80\GeVc and the sub-leading photon candidates of the same event must have $\pt > 45\GeVc$. Because the Particle Flow~(PF) algorithm does not consider out-of-time isolated photon energy deposits, we do not use the PF photon isolation criteria but rather a \textit{simple cut-based} isolation requirement where we request that there should be no tracks near the selected photon within a range in $\Delta R(\gamma, track) < 0.6$. Tracker, ECAL and HCAL isolation based on the photon \pt and \et, must be within the accepted range required by the simple cut-based approach given in Table \ref{tab:PhotonSel}. The ratio of the photon energy  deposit in HCAL to ECAL must be less than 5\% to avoid misidentifying high fraction electromagnetic and neutral component jets as photons and the photon shower shape along the minor axis~($S_{Minor}$) must be be within 0.12 and 0.38 to avoid selecting spikes as photons. To prevent double counting jets with high electromagnetic energy component as photons with other photons, the photon must be isolated from any other particle in a cone size of $\Delta R(\gamma, \mbox{Other particle})< 0.4$. 
We only selected photons belonging to the barrel~(EB) region \ie $|\eta_{\gamma}| < 1.479$ since we observed many out-of-time photon candidates from ghost/satellite bunch collisions belong to the endcap~(EE) shown in Figure \ref{fig:TIMEECAL} of a photon ECAL time comparison between photon candidates belonging to EB and EE.
Our photon selection requirement is summarized in Table \ref{tab:PhotonSel}.
\newline
For jets, we select jets reconstructed with the PF algorithm based on the CMS standard good quality jet identification selection criteria presented in Table \ref{tab:JetSel}. We require the leading jet in the event to have a \pt of at least 35\GeVc.
\newline
As for Missing Transverse Energy~(MET) selection requirement, with inspiration from our trigger event selection efficiency plot in MET in Figure \ref{fig:HLTEff}, we observed that a missing energy of at least 60\GeV for \ETslash\hspace{0.15cm} and ${\ETslash}^{\gamma}\hspace{0.15cm}$ is enough to suppress $\gamma + $jets and QCD events with fake missing transverse energy.

\section{Background Estimation}
Most of our background events with out-of-time photons are non-collision events produced from many different sources. In order to qualify and quantify the different sources, we compare in-time~($|t_{\gamma}| < 1$~ns) photon candidates to out-of-time~($t_{\gamma} < -3$~ns and $t_{\gamma} > 2$~ns) photon candidates.
By also comparing photon candidates of events with different number of jets, we were able to uncover the different background sources and better quantify their contribution. In Figure \ref{fig:BKGPLOTS}, we present scatter plots of the photon's ECAL time against $\eta$~(left) and against $\phi$~(right) for events with photon $\pt < 60\GeV$, belonging to both the barrel and endcap regions and event $\ETslash\hspace{0.15cm} > 25\GeV$.

\vspace{5mm}
From these plots, we observe that, although most of the photons arrive with ECAL time about zero, a good number of photons are out-of-time and from very different sources, for example, the cross-like feature seen in the plot on the left, is particular to photons with earlier ECAL time while the step-like pattern in ECAL time extends to all out-of-time photons but is more prominent to photons which belong to the endcap regions~($1.479 < \eta_{\gamma} < 3$) and have late ECAL time. The high concentration of out-of-time photons at $\phi=0\pm\pi$ on the right plot indicate a unique source of non-collision events which is not random. We conclude that the possible sources of background photon candidates with out-of-time can be split into photons from beam halo muons, because of the cross-like feature and high population at $\pi=0\pm\pi$, cosmic muons, due to the random distribution of out-of-time photons throughout ECAL and spikes, due to the high concentration of photons with ECAL time of about -12.5~ns. The step-like feature can be attributed to photons arising from ghost/satellite bunch collisions while a small contribution of out-of-time photons is from QCD  and electroweak events. To reduce the contamination of possible signal out-of-time photons from spikes which contribute the most to events with out-of-time photons particularly with ECAL time around $t_{\gamma} \approx -12$~ns, we restrict our event selection to photons with ECAL time $ 2.0 < t_{\gamma} < 13.0$~ns and $-10.0 < t_{\gamma} < -3$~ns, making our search restricted to signal events with photon ECAL time between $2.0 < t_{\gamma} < 13.0$~ns.
\newline
For our background estimation study, we split the background events into two categories: Collision and Non-Collision events. We first identify and reject photon candidates from beam halo, cosmic muons and spikes and then estimate the residual non-collision and collision background photon candidates  using the \textbf{\textsf{ABCD}} background estimation technique. 

\subsection{Collision Background}
\subsubsection{QCD Photons}
Events from satellite/ghost proton bunches described in section \ref{Ghost}, produce out-of-time photons which can be present in the barrel. Because these photons are produced from collisions just like QCD events, we refer to these photons as QCD photons. It is challenging to define a strategy for rejecting this background events. Our approach, after rejecting non-collsiion events, is to estimate their contribution to signal using the \textsf{ABCD} background estimation method. We also perform a separate background estimation using a control sample of \PZ events, and show that background contributions from events with QCD photon candidates from satellite/ghost is almost negligible.% We elaborate more on this in the collision background estimation section.%We will More on this is discussed in future sections.
%%%%
\subsection{Non-Collision Background}
%We study non-collision background events from beam halo muons, cosmic muons, and spikes using a data sample of zero and one jet events passing all our event selection requirements.
% These events consist of have photons with large reconstructed time and large \ETslash\hspace{0.15cm} measurements. The high \pt photons from these energetic muons and possible overlapping  pile up events from multiple $pp$ collisions, contribute to the total sum of the PF reconstructed \pt imbalance leading to their large \ETslash\hspace{0.15cm} and at times jets associated with these events.
%We select events with at least one good vertex, zero or one jet, photons satisfying ECAL spike cleaning, associated with candidate muons satisfying DT time cosmic muon cleaning and CSC tight halo-muon cleaning requirements to study these non-collision events. 
%A schematic diagram in Figure \ref{fig:NeutDecay} show the production of photons from both non-collision and collision{ghost/satellite} in a typical LHC $pp$ collision within the CMS detector. Also shown is a typical photon from a neutralino decay in the GMSB model. Still on the diagram is shown the point of entry of beam halo muons into the CMS detector comparing to what is observed in the photon ECAl time against $\eta$ and $\phi$ plots of Figure \ref{fig:BKGPLOTS}.

%%%%%

\subsubsection{Halo Photons}
Protons in the main and sometimes ghost/satellite bunches can, through inelastic scattering with residual gas molecules like $\mbox{H}_{2}$ and C$\mbox{O}_{2}$ in beam pipe, produce pions which later decay into muons called \textit{Beam Halo} muons, traveling with energy of about a few \TeV. These energetic muons radiate energetic photons called \textit{Halo photons} in the calorimeter through a process called \textit{bremsstrahlung}. It is also possible that beam halo muons can be produced when protons scatter off Tertiary Collimators~(TCT), due to proton beam deflection by the magnets, just before entering the CMS detector.
The halo muons can travel nearly parallel to the main proton bunch but often stir away from the nominal orbit in the transverse direction spreading mostly in the horizontal plane, with respect to the CMS detector coordinates, due to betatron oscillations. Despite beam cleaning, a sizable population of beam halo muons remains eventually producing energetic photons in the calorimeters. A scatter plot of the photon ECAL time against $\phi$  shown earlier in the right plot of Figure \ref{fig:BKGPLOTS}, show that most of these beam halo muons enter the ECAL in the horizontal plane at $\phi=0,\pm\pi$. The rate of halo photons in the general proton \textit{Beam-Induced Background}~(BIB) events depend on the beam current and the operational conditions of the LHC like the  machine optics, collimator settings, residual gas densities and RF cavity filling scheme. 
\newline
The halo muons before entry into ECAL, produce hits which can be reconstructed into muon tracks using segments in the Cathode Strip Chambers~(CSC) Endcap muon detectors. The reconstructed hits in the CSC segments can be associated with a halo photon supercluster in ECAL within some narrow opening angle in $\phi$. The geometry of ECAL allows most of the halo muons in the endcaps but also enough in the barrel. The resulting halo photons are usually out-of-time compared to photons produced directly from nominal $pp$ collisions and most of them have earlier arrival time in cases where the beam halo muons arrive at the ECAL crystals before $pp$ collisions occur at the interaction point. This arrival time can be estimated from the unique flight path of the beam halo muons with respect to the arrival time of photons from $pp$ collisions as 
\begin{equation}{\label{eq:HALOPATH}}
t^{\mbox{expected}}_{\mbox{ECAL}} = -1/c\left( \pm Z_{\mbox{cluster}} + \sqrt{Z^{2}_{\mbox{cluster}} + R^{2}_{\mbox{cluster}}}  \right),
\end{equation}
where $Z_{\mbox{cluster}}$ is the point where the halo muon hits ECAL or longitudinal distance along $z$-axis of the halo photon supercluster position from the nominal interaction point, $R$ is the radial distance of the supercluster from the beam line which is the radius of ECAL equal to $1.29$\m and $c$ is the speed of light in vacuum. The estimated halo muon ECAL arrival time can be re-arrange to become
\begin{equation}{\label{eq:HALOPATH2}}
t^{\mbox{expected}}_{\mbox{ECAL}} = - \frac{R}{2c} \exp^{(-\eta)}
\end{equation} 
showing the explicit dependence on $\eta$, for the beam halo muon entry point in ECAL. Comparing this estimated time shown in Figure \ref{fig:HALO} as the two red lines, with observation from data for the 2-dimensional plot of ECAL time $vs$ $\eta$ of photon candidates, show a nice agreement especially for earlier arrival time photon candidates.

\par
By matching halo muon hit positions in CSC segments to photon supercluster positions in the ECAL calorimeter in $\phi$, since halo muons spread mostly in the horizontal plane or azimuthal~($\phi$) direction, we are able to match halo muons to their corresponding halo photons. We use the quantity, $\Delta\phi(\mbox{CSC Seg},\gamma)$, which is the difference in $\phi$ between the CSC segment  and the photon supercluster position in ECAL, to express this matching. A plot of $\Delta\phi(\mbox{CSC Seg},\gamma)$ for in-time and out-of-time photons is shown in the left plot of Figure \ref{fig:HALO}. We see that out-of-time photons have small $\Delta\phi(\mbox{CSC Seg},\gamma)$ confirming that some out-of-time photons are produced by beam halo muons.

To estimate the performance of using $\Delta\phi(\mbox{CSC Seg},\gamma)$ for tagging events with halo photons, we use a halo photon candidate sample of selected events with photons in the endcaps where we expect mostly halo photon candidates and with $\phi_{\gamma}$ around $\phi = 0, \pm \pi$. We were able to tag with $\Delta\phi(\mbox{CSC Seg},\gamma) < 0.05$, a good number of photon candidates as halo photons in the endcaps shown in the Figure \ref{fig:HALOENDCAP} comparing halo photons in the endcaps to tagged halo photons in the endcaps.

\subsubsection{Cosmic Photons} 
Cosmic muons produced in cosmic rays, like beam halo muons, with sufficient energy will radiate~(bremsstrahlung) photons in ECAL. We refer to these photons as \textit{Cosmic Photons}. Unlike halo muons, cosmic muons can arrive at ECAL from any direction at any time. We expect cosmic photons in the barrel produced from cosmic muons, to have hits in the Drift Tubes~(DT) segments found in the muon barrel behind the calorimeters. Using DT segments and  photon supercluster $\eta-\phi$ position in ECAL, we can match cosmic muon hits in DT segments to ECAL photon superclusters within a narrow window in $\Delta\eta$ and $\Delta\phi$. The DT position used in the calculation of $\Delta\eta$ and $\Delta\phi$ is a projection of the muon trajectory using the direction of the DT segment to the outer surface of ECAL because of the large space between the muon barrel and the ECAL. The two dimensional distribution for $\Delta\eta(\mbox{DT Seg},\gamma)$ and $\Delta\phi(\mbox{DT Seg},\gamma)$ of this matching, for events with out-of-time photons; $t_{\gamma} > 2$~ns and $t_{\gamma} < -3$~ns, is shown in the right plot of Figure \ref{fig:COSMIC}. We compared to $\Delta\eta(\mbox{DT Seg},\gamma)$ and $\Delta\phi(\mbox{DT Seg},\gamma)$ distribution for in-time~($|t_{\gamma}| < 1$~ns), shown in the left plot, still in the same figure, we observed that most out-of-time photons have a small $\Delta\eta$ and $\Delta\phi$. Comparing the $\Delta\eta$  and $\Delta\phi$ 2-dimensional distributions of these out-of-time photons to photons from a pure cosmic muons sample~(data taken when no proton-proton collisions is happening), shown in Figure \ref{fig:TRUECOSMIC}, we found a similar small $\Delta\eta$ and $\Delta\phi$ occupancy for the true cosmic muons sample. We conclude that small $\Delta\eta(\mbox{DT Seg},\gamma)$  and $\Delta\phi(\mbox{DT Seg},\gamma)$ can be used to tag and reject events with cosmic photons.

\subsubsection{Anomalous Photons: Spikes}
Neutrons and charge hadrons can at times deposit their energy directly to the APDs instead of going through the crystal scintillation process. Such signals read from the APDs are \textit{anomalous}  and referred to as \textit{spikes}. Spikes produced from $pp$ collisions and satisfying photon selection requirement can easily be identified as photons. A spike supercluster consists of very few crystals; most often one or two crystals. Spikes can also overlapped with real photons and found embedded in a real photon supercluster or buried inside of jets. Such embedded spikes are challenging to identify. By looking at the signal pulse height, the pulse shape for a spike signal appear different from a signal form an electromagnetic particle. Because of this difference in pulse shape profile, the reconstructed ECAL time for spikes usually have large calculated $\chi^{2}$ values.
\newline
The arrival time of spikes is much earlier~(negative), usually about $t \approx -12.0$~ns than for photons produced in nominal $pp$ collisions depositing their energy in the APD through crystal scintillation. This is because of the absence of the scintilation process which takes on average 10~ns. The few crystals containing the spike cluster energy deposits make it possible for spikes to be identified using a energy topological selection quantity, $1-\frac{E_{4}}{E_{1}}$, also know as \textit{swiss-cross} variable.  By looking at a distribution shown in right plot of Figure 
\ref{fig:SPIKES}, of the swiss-cross for in-time and for events from a spike sample~(events with photon with time $t = -12$~ns),  we observed that most spikes have about 98\% of their energy deposited in a single crystal.
\newline
Using the number of crystals in a photon supercluster and comparing the number of crystals in in-time photons to halo photons and spike candidate photons~(photons with $1-\frac{E_{4}}{E_{1}}> 0.98$) shown in the left plot of Figure \ref{fig:SPIKES}, we observed that most spikes including spikes embedded in electromagnetic candidates have less than $7$ crystals in their supercluster. A combination of the swiss-cross, number of crystals in supercluster, calculated $\chi^{2}$ from ECAL time, $S_{Major}$ and $ S_{Minor}$~(both $S_{Major}$ and $ S_{Minor}$ describe the shape of the electromagnetic shower) is useful for identifying and rejecting events with spikes.

\subsection{Event Vetoing, Performance and Fake Rates}
Using the quantities studied for tagging events with halo, cosmic and spike photons, we tag and veto non-collision background  events as follows: 
\begin{itemize}
\item An event with a halo photon is tagged and vetoed if a CSC segment for $|\eta| > 1.6$ is found within 0.05 radian of the azimuthal angle with the photon supercluster, \ie a photon found within $\Delta\phi(\mbox{CSC Seg},\gamma) < 0.05$ is vetoed. We found that we are able to veto events with a  halo photon with 91\% efficiency and 3\% mis-tag rate using this photon selection requirement.
\item An event with cosmic photon is tagged and vetoed with $75.5$\% efficiency and $1.4$\% mis-tag rate if the photon can be matched to a DT segment within $\Delta\eta(\mbox{DT Seg},\gamma) < 0.1$ and $\Delta\phi(\mbox{DT Seg},\gamma) < 0.1$.
\item An event with spike is vetoed if the photon has ECAL time $\chi^{2} > 4$, $\mbox{Number of crystals} < 7$, $ 1-E_{4}/E_{1} > 0.98$,$S_{Major} < 0.6$ and $S_{Minor} < 0.17$ with only $0.4$\% mis-tag rate.
\end{itemize}
Presented in Table \ref{tab:EVTC}, is a summary for the mis-tag rates of the different non-collision background sources.

The result of the event tagging is shown in Figure \ref{fig:RESIDUAL}. We observe that the majority of non-collision background events are events with a halo photon. Very few late arrival time photons are produced from spikes. The is also some significant contribution from cosmic photons. The most interesting observation is the residual out-of-time background~(in red) which could not be tagged.

\vspace{5mm}
These residual untagged events comprise of some non-collision events, since the tagging and vetoing are not 100\% efficient, events with QCD photons from ghost/satellite collisions and events with $\PW\rightarrow \Pe\Pagne$ decay with the fake photon passing the photon selection requirement. In order to quantify our estimates of these different sources contributing to the untagged background events, we use control samples defined with ${\ETslash}^{\gamma}\hspace{0.15cm}$ and \ETslash\hspace{0.25cm}. %, recalling that $\vec{{\ETslash}^{\gamma}\hspace{0.15cm}} = \vec{\ETslash\hspace{0.15cm}} + \vec{\pt^{\gamma}}$ adjusting for out-of-time energy deposits not included in the standard missing transverse energy calculations. 
\newline
We expect signal events, because of the undetected gravitino from the neutralino decay, to have large ${\ETslash}^{\gamma}\hspace{0.15cm}$ and \ETslash\hspace{0.15cm}, by large, we mean above 60\GeV, and events with $\PW\rightarrow \Pe\Pagne$ decay to equally have large ${\ETslash}^{\gamma}\hspace{0.15cm}$ and \ETslash\hspace{0.15cm} because of the undetected neutrino. The non-collision~(cosmic, halo, spike) and collision~(ghost/sattelite or QCD) background events can be categorized into high-\pt and low-\pt events.
For high-\pt non-collision events, we expect these events to have large \ETslash\hspace{0.15cm}, due to the exclusion of the energy deposits from the out-of-time photons in the missing transverse energy reconstruction, and small ${\ETslash}^{\gamma}\hspace{0.15cm}$ when the large transverse energy contribution from the energy deposits of the out-of-time photons is re-introduced, while for low-\pt non-collision events, we expect these events to have both ${\ETslash}^{\gamma}\hspace{0.15cm}$ and \ETslash\hspace{0.15cm} small, since the out-of-time photon transverse energy, which was excluded, was in the first place small. For high-\pt out-of-time collision events which usually have small missing transverse energy, we expect their \ETslash\hspace{0.25cm} to be small and after re-introducing the energy deposits from out-of-time high-\pt photons, we expect their ${\ETslash}^{\gamma}\hspace{0.15cm}$ to be large, while, using the same argument made for low-\pt non-collision events, we expect low-\pt collision events to have both small ${\ETslash}^{\gamma}\hspace{0.15cm}$ and \ETslash\hspace{0.15cm}.
A summary of our expectations for ${\ETslash}^{\gamma}\hspace{0.15cm}$ and \ETslash\hspace{0.15cm} for the different expected background events sources with possible contribution to the residual untagged events with out-of-time photon is presented in Table \ref{tab:METSAMPLE}.

\vspace{5mm}
%Therefore, to minimizing contributions from events anomalous photon time, we restrict our photon arrival time for signal events to within $3.0 < t_{\gamma} < 13.0$~ns, while also requiring that the signal event missing transverse energy be greater than 60\GeV, \ie ${\ETslash}^{\gamma}\hspace{0.15cm} > 60$\GeV, $\ETslash\hspace{0.15cm} > 60$\GeV. This reduces the contribution from ghost/satellite background contributing to the untagged out-of-time photons while at the same time enhances our signal event sample.
\clearpage
Using control samples defined using \ETslash\hspace{0.15cm} and ${\ETslash}^{\gamma}\hspace{0.15cm}$ for events with in-time~($|t_{\gamma}| < 2.0$~ns) photons, 
events with photon time, $t_{\gamma} > 3.0$~ns and $t_{\gamma} < -3.0$~ns, where each control sample is defined purposely to enhance the contribution of either collision or non-collision background events to that control sample while simultaneously suppressing contributions from the other, we perform a background estimation in the signal control sample~($t_{\gamma} > 3.0$~ns, ${\ETslash}^{\gamma}\hspace{0.15cm} > 60$\GeV and $\ETslash\hspace{0.15cm} > 60$\GeV) using the so-called \textsf{ABCD} background estimation method.
We verify that the background estimation method is performing as expected using a data sample of zero and one jet events.
% with out-of-time photons, $t_{\gamma} > 3.0$~ns and  ${\ETslash}^{\gamma}\hspace{0.15cm} > 60$\GeV, $\ETslash\hspace{0.15cm} > 60$\GeV  is supposed to be the same if the method is valid. One of our assumption for using the ABCD method is that the background contributions from QCD events and multijets events is negligible. We also study the consequences of this assumption on the number of background estimated events with a separate control sample of mostly out-of-time photon candidates used in reconstructing the true \PZ mass and measure the its candidate electron's arrival time at ECAL since for these events we expect most of the electrons from the $\PZ \rightarrow \EE$ decay to be in-time. Thus, the observed number of out-of-time electron candidates gives us an estimate of the contributions of collision events in our signal sample.

\subsection{Background Estimation with ABDC Method}
Since we expect most of our background events to come from non-collision events, we estimate the number of events we expect from non-collision events in the signal control sample using the \textsf{ABCD} technique. We also estimate the possible contamination, we expect from collision events, to the control samples used in the \textsf{ABCD} method.
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Non-Collision Background Estimation}:\newline
To estimate the number of background events from non-collision, we define Control Samples~(CS), labeled as \textsf{ABCD}, in photon ECAL time and ${\ETslash}^{\gamma}\hspace{0.15cm}$ for selected events with $\ETslash\hspace{0.15cm} > 60$\GeV. Events with $\ETslash\hspace{0.15cm} > 60$\GeV define a CS  where the contribution from collision~(QCD) background events is suppressed, since most collision background events have small \ETslash\hspace{0.15cm}, as we saw in Table \ref{tab:METSAMPLE}. The control samples; \textsf{A} and \textsf{B}, shown in Table \ref{tab:NON-COLLISION}, are events with, respectively, ${\ETslash}^{\gamma}\hspace{0.15cm} < 60$\GeV and ${\ETslash}^{\gamma}\hspace{0.15cm} > 60$\GeV  and photon ECAL time, $-10.0 < t_{\gamma} < -3.0$~ns, and CS \textsf{C} have events with ${\ETslash}^{\gamma}\hspace{0.15cm} < 60$\GeV  and photon ECAL time, $3.0 < t_{\gamma} < 13.0$~ns.

 Using these control samples for the \textsf{ABCD}  method, and with the assumption that $\frac{N_{D}}{N_{C}} = \frac{N_{B}}{N_{A}}$, the number of non-collision background events with out-of-time photons expected in the signal  CS \textsf{D} is given as
\begin{equation}
N^{non-col}_{D} = \left(\frac{N_{B}}{N_{A}} \right)\cdot N_{C},
\end{equation}
where $N_{B}$, $N_{A}$  and $N_{C}$ are the number of events observed in \textsf{B}, \textsf{A} and \textsf{C} control samples in that order and $N^{non-col}_{D}$ is the number of non-collision background events we expect in the signal CS \textsf{D}.

\item\textbf{Collision Background Estimation}:\newline
We estimate the number of collision background events contaminating CSs defined in Table \ref{tab:NON-COLLISION}, by once again using the \textsf{ABCD} technique with the Control Samples~(CSs) used defined in photon ECAL time and \ETslash\hspace{0.15cm} for selected events with ${\ETslash}^{\gamma}\hspace{0.15cm} > 60$\GeV. We are interested in the contamination from collision background events to CS \textsf{B} and \textsf{D} of Table \ref{tab:NON-COLLISION}, since these are the CSs where we expect events with large missing transverse energy~(see Table \ref{tab:METSAMPLE}).
Most collisions events have photons with in-time~($|t_{\gamma}| < 2$~ns), therefore, we use CSs defined with in-time photons to estimate the number of possible collision events with out-of-time photons contributing to CSs \textsf{B} and \textsf{D}. The CSs used for the new \textsf{ABCD} method to perform the collision background estimation are labeled as \textsf{$A^{\prime}$ $B^{\prime}$ $C^{\prime}$  $D^{\prime}$} and defined as shown in Table \ref{tab:COLLISION}.

where $N_{D}^{Total} = N_{D}^{non-col} + N_{D}^{col}$ is the total background events estimated in our signal CS \textsf{D} coming from non-collision and collision background events.

\paragraph*{Background Estimation Technique Validation}\mbox{}\\
We performed a validity test of our background estimation method using a data sample of $0$ and $1$-jet events, where we do not expect any signal events.
A statistical agreement in the number of expected background events obtained using our background estimation method and the number of events observed in our signal CS \textsf{D}, will indicate provide a positive affirmation that the method. The accepted $0$ and $1$-jet events used must pass the same event selection requirements as potential signal events described in Tables \ref{tab:PhotonSel} and \ref{tab:JetSel}. The event yields in each control sample including the tagging of beam-halo, cosmic and spike events is shown in Table \ref{tab:EVTYIELD}.

\end{center}
\end{minipage}

\vspace{5mm}
Using the event yields in Table \ref{tab:EVTYIELD} for each CS, and Equations \ref{eq:COLB}, \ref{eq:COLD} and \ref{eq:FBKG}, we obtain the following estimates for the expected number of events in signal CS \textsf{D} as
\begin{align*} 
 N_{B}^{col} &= \frac{35464}{1446522} \times 8 = 0.20^{+0.08}_{-0.06} \\
 N_{D}^{col} &= \frac{35464}{1446522} \times 2 = 0.05^{+0.05}_{-0.02} \\
 N_{D}^{Total} &= \left( \frac{39 - 0.20}{852}\times 359\right) +  0.05 = 16.40^{+3.04}_{-2.63}.
\end{align*}
The uncertainty are statistical uncertainties based on the event statistics in each CS. Our expected number of background events in signal CS \textsf{D} is $16.40^{+3.04}_{-2.63}$  which is, within the statistical uncertainties, agreeable with the 10 events we observed satisfying all our event selection requirements and belonging to the CS \textsf{D}. 
This give us confidence that our method is working and should be used in our background estimation method for potential signal events from data sample.
% We observed $10$ events while from using Equation \ref{eq:FBKG}, we expected $16.78^{+2.95}_{-3.45}$. We argue that within our statistical uncertainties, there is quite an agreement between our expectation and observed events. The complete result from our closure test is shown in Table \ref{tab:EVTC}. This gives us confidence that our  background estimation method is robust and reliable. We apply the same \textsf{ABCD} to estimate the background contribution in our signal sample. Our signal sample consist of events with at least $2$-jets, at least a single photon and ${\ETslash}^{\gamma}\hspace{0.15cm} > 60$\GeV, $\ETslash\hspace{0.15cm} > 60$\GeV

\subsection{Background Estimation Cross Check}
Another method for estimating background events with out-of-time photons from collision, which we did, is using $\PZ \rightarrow \EE$ events. Since we expect most of the events with electron candidates from \PZ decay to be in-time due to the prompt nature of the decay of \PZ bosons, we use events with electron candidates from a \texttt{SingleElectron} and \texttt{DoubleElectron} data samples of 2012, where we expect the contributions from non-collision events to be very small, to do the estimation. These events are selected such that out-of-time energy deposits in ECAL from electron candidates are accepted. The background events with out-of-time energy deposits are mostly events produced from the Drell-Yan process, where electron candidates can be matched randomly to produce a di-electron mass close to the mass of \PZ and poorly reconstructed out-of-time  energy deposits in ECAL. To further reduce any out-of-time contribution from beam halo and cosmic events, which can occur simultaneously with true $pp$ collision events, we require that events with \PZ candidates must satisfy the following event selection requirements: the two electron candidates of the \PZ boson must each have a $\pt > 30$\GeV/c, di-electron mass, $|m_{\EE} - 91| > 61$\GeV/cc, and both electrons must be in the barrel, \ie $|\eta_{e^{-}}| < 1.479$ and $ |\eta_{e^{+}}| < 1.479$.
\newline
From these selected \PZ candidate events, we define a signal event sample where the \PZ candidates have a well defined di-electron mass between $76 < |m_{\EE}| < 100$~$GeV/c^{2}$ and a background or sideband event sample where the di-electron mass is either between $50\GeVcc < m_{\EE} < 76$\GeVcc or $100\GeVcc < m_{\EE} < 130$\GeVcc. 
\newline
The electron ECAL arrival time is taken to be the seed crystal time adjusted to account for the electron time of flight. The seed crystal must satisfy the recommended crystal~(reconstructed hit) cleaning criteria which requires that the seed crystal is not a spike, is not noisy and has been properly time calibrated.
A scatter plot of the arrival ECAL time against $\eta$~(top plots) and  $\phi$~(bottom plots) of the electron candidate of \PZ is shown in Figure \ref{fig:Elec}. A clear difference in the scatter distributions of events is seen comparing events from the \texttt{Single/DoubleElectron} data sample~(plots on the right) which do not have the familiar beam halo features~(the X-shape and increase event population around $\phi = 0,\pm \pi$) to events from \texttt{SinglePhoton} data sample~(plots on the left). 
This confirms our expectation that the candidate \PZ event sample is free from contamination from non-collision events and thus a good sample for estimating out-of-time event contributions from collisions.

The di-electron mass~(left plots) and electron arrival time~(right plots) of both electron candidates of the \PZ boson for signal~(blue) and sideband~(red) events is shown in Figure \ref{fig:Zmass}. The out-of-time background contribution to the true \PZ events sample is estimated using a \textit{sideband subtraction method} described as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item We fit the di-electron candidate mass distribution of the sideband control sample with a polynomial function(see top plots of Figure  \ref{fig:collZ}) to extract the background template.
\item Using the background template, we obtain a scale factor as 
\begin{equation}
\mbox{Scale Factor} = \frac{N}{M_{1} + M_{2}},
\end{equation}
shown in the bottom plot of Figure \ref{fig:collZ}, which we used to determine the correct contribution of the background events to the signal event sample.
\item After scaling the electrons arrival ECAL time distribution~(red distribution on the bottom right plot in Figure \ref{fig:Zmass}) of the sideband control sample using the extracted scale factor, we subtract the scaled time distribution from the time distribution~(blue distribution of right plot in Figure \ref{fig:Zmass}) of \PZ electron candidates from the signal sample. The resulting ECAL time distribution, shown in Figure \ref{fig:Ztime} is the time distribution from true \PZ events. This ECAL time distribution is used to estimate the number of events with out-of-time electromagnetic particles from collision.
\item The ratio of the total number of events with the electron ECAL time, $t > 3$~ns, to those with electron ECAL time, $|t| < 2$~ns, \ie $ N_{t > 3~ns}/ N_{|t| < 2.0~ns}$, gives an estimate of the fraction of out-of-time background events from collision.

  The estimated ratio for out-of-time events to in-time collision events for the final time distribution of signal electron candidates after the normalized sideband subtraction, shown in Figure \ref{fig:Ztime} is about, $N_{t > 3~ns}/ N_{|t| < 2.0~ns} = 1.29 ^{+0.374}_{-0.325} \times 10^{-5}$.
\par
To obtain an estimate of the number of background events from collisions in the signal control sample \textsf{D}, $N^{col}_{D}$, of the \PSneutralinoOne decay, we multiply this estimated ratio to the total number of in-time events~(CS \textsf{$I$}), shown in Table \ref{tab:RESULT}, passing our final signal event selections requirements, which is $28282$. This gives $N^{col}_{D} = 0.366^{+0.106}_{-0.092}$ events. Comparing this to the value obtained with the \textsf{ABCD} method, which is $\frac{28283}{1446522} = 0.0391^{+0.039}_{-0.047}$ events, we find that the two methods of estimating the number of background events from collision are not exactly equal. 
\par
We cannot interpret this inequality  as a disagreement between both methods for estimating the number of background events from collision. On the contrary, this non-agreement can be explained. We have not applied any \MET selection requirements for the \PZ candidate events selection. A simple cut in missing transverse energy, $\MET > 60$\GeV, could further reduce the estimated ratio, $N_{t > 3~ns}/ N_{|t| < 2.0~ns}$, to a very smaller number than what we got. In fact, the smallness of this ratio confirms our speculation that indeed the contribution from collision events with out-of-time electromagnetic particles to our background events is almost negligible~(less than a single event) such that the uncertainties on the ratio of out-of-time to in-time events used in our \textsf{ABCD} collision background estimation is irrelevant. This means, the number $N^{col}_{D} = 0.366^{+0.106}_{-0.092}$, can be used for our estimated number of background events from collision and our final results will not change by a lot.

\section{Systematic Studies}
Our event selection comprise of the following selection cuts: photon \pt greater than 80\GeVc, jet \pt greater than 35\GeVc and missing energy greater than 60\GeV. The same selection requirements applied to our MC signal event sample should guarantee a good event selection efficiency. Any difference in the photon \pt, jet \pt and missing transverse energy between MC and data, will be a source of systematic uncertainties on the efficiency of selecting signal events. These uncertainties can come from quantities like jet energy scale~(JES), jet energy resolution~(JER), electron-photon energy scale, instrumentation related and missed or energy deposits not clustered during missing transverse energy reconstruction, photon ECAL arrival time bias and ECAL time resolution. The different sources of uncertainties considered in this analysis is presented in Table \ref{tab:SYST}. We obtain these uncertainties by varying the nominal values of each quantity, while keeping the others fixed, by $1\sigma$ deviation and counting the number of events passing our event selection requirements. Our largest uncertainty is from ECAL timing bias on the absolute reference time~(zero ns) of the ECAL timing used for measuring the photon arrival time. This has the largest impact on our analysis since our analysis is based on counting the number of events with photon ECAL time above $3$~ns. The next largest uncertainties are from energy deposits not clustered. This affects the photon energy scale, missing energy scale,  jet energy scale and resolution.
\newline
The uncertainty on the photon energy scale in the barrel was estimated to be 4.0\%  based on measuring the photon energy of events with $Z\rightarrow \mu\mu\gamma$ decay, where the muon radiates a photon in a process known as the final-state radiation~(FSR)\cite{PES}.  
\newline
The uncertainty on the \MET resolution uses a conservative estimate from \MET measurements in QCD events \cite{METRES}. 
\newline
The uncertainty on the ECAL time resolution was obtained by comparing the mean time of photons of events from $\gamma +$ jet MC sample to events from data with photon ECAL time, $|t_{\gamma}| < 2$~ns. The difference is found to be of the order of 200~ps per event. 
\newline
The systematic uncertainty on luminosity measurement has the recommended value of $2.2$\% provided by CMS and LHC luminosity measurements while the uncertainty from pardon density functions~(PDF) is evaluated using the re-weighting technique which uses the Master Equation of CTEQ65 model set described in \cite{PDF}.
\par
Another important source of systematic is in the selection of the background control samples and our background estimation and individual systematic in the tagging and mistagging of non-collision background and estimating background contributions from collisions. We combined these separate uncertainty contributions into a single background estimation uncertainty referred here as our background estimation uncertain. 
However, since our background estimation is data-driven, most of the uncertainties arising due to systematic can be neglected~(less than 1\% impact) as the cancel out.
This is our largest source of uncertainty in our analysis which we estimate to vary it upward by 223\% and downward by 51\% as a statistical uncertainty in the \textsf{ABCD} background estimation method. The large background statistical uncertainty is due to very low event statistics. However, despite the large background estimation uncertainty, the signal selection uncertainties are the most significant uncertainties which impact our final results. These uncertainties are used as nuissance parameters in the calculation of the upper limit on observed signal cross-section~($\sigma_{UL}$).

\section{Results}
After running our analysis on the SinglePhoton data samples requiring events with at least 2 jets, at least one photon with ECAL time  $ 3.0 < t_{\gamma} < 13.0$~ns, ${\ETslash}^{\gamma}\hspace{0.15cm} > 60$\GeV, and $\ETslash\hspace{0.15cm} > 60$\GeV, we observed a single event passing all our event selection requirements as a signal event. This event has one photon and two jets. The photon has a transverse momentum  of 224\GeVc and an ECAL time of 12.17~ns.
\newline
Our final expected number of background events estimated is $0.093^{+0.301}_{-0.047}$. This number was computed as
\begin{align*} 
 N_{B}^{col} &= \frac{28283}{605496} \times 3 = 0.140^{+0.108}_{-0.061} \\
 N_{D}^{col} &= \frac{28283}{605496} \times 2 = 0.093^{+0.093}_{-0.047} \\
 N_{D}^{Total} &= \left( \frac{1 - 0.14}{3}\times 0\right) +  0.093 = 0.093^{+0.301}_{-0.047}.
\end{align*}
