The world belongs to tomorrow not yesterday. Don\textquotesingle t give anybody else permission to take your life away, just keep living and keep giving and never make the perfect enemy the good.Never think that what I\textquotesingle m doing is too little to make a difference, THAT\textquotesingle S NOT TRUE!, THAT\textquotesingle S NOT TRUE!  Do something everyday. Someday, for all of us, it will be our last day and what would matter will be all the steps we took along the way and what they amounted to, NOT the home run we hit on day X. I wish you well.”}

\textit{No, I have nothing against Mr. Einstein. He is a kind person and has done many good things, some of which will become part of the music. I will write to him and try to explain that the ether exists, and that its particles are what keep the Universe in harmony, and the life in eternity}.
