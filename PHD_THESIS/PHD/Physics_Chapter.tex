\section{The Standard Model of Particle Physics}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The Standard Model~(SM) provides a thorough and experimentally valid description of the fundamental constituents of baryonic matter and interactions~(except gravity) in our universe. Predictions using the SM agree with most of the available experimental data with unmatched precision.
However, there are some theoretical and experimental difficulties with the model, such as, the experimental evidence for the existence of Dark Matter~(DM) and neutrino masses not explained by the SM.  As a result, it is accepted that the SM could be the lower energy version of a much general model and concept like \textit{supersymmetery}.
%\paragraph{}
The following section briefly describes the SM giving its major  components, its strengths and its limitations.
\subsection{Main Components}
Fundamental particles are characterized in terms of their Mass, Charge and Spin and lifetime. Spin is a non-spatial or \textit{internal} quantum number unlike mass and charge. The spin of a particle can be integer or half-integer.
Fermions are ordinary matter, half-integer spin~($\frac{1}{2} \hbar$) particles distributed in a \textit{Fermi-Dirac} distribution, meaning no two identical fermions can occupy the same state. They can be massive or massless, charged or be neutral. Anti-fermions have the same mass as fermions but have an opposite charge.

Advances in theory and experiment with the observation of a spin-0 boson on the 4th of July 2012, reveals a set for classifying fundamental particles in describing our universe. We refer to this set as the \textit{universe set} given as:

\begin{equation*}
S =\{ \cdots \mathbf{0}, \frac{1}{2}, 1,  \frac{3}{2}, 2  \cdots \}\hbar 
\end{equation*}
 $S$ is the spin of a particle and $\hbar$ is the fundamental \textit{Planck} constant. 
 This universal set represents our past, current and probably future understanding of the universe. We can summarize our present understanding as:
 \begin{itemize}
  \item $\mathbf{S = \frac{1}{2}\hbar}$ Particles which make up all the matter in our universe.
  \item $\mathbf{S = 1\hbar}$ Mediating particles for gauge interactions.
  \item $\mathbf{S = 0\hbar}$ The fundamental particle responsible for giving mass to other particles.
  \item $\mathbf{S = 2\hbar}$ Mediator for gravitational interactions~(might be gauged).
  \item $\mathbf{S = \frac{3}{2}\hbar}$ Particles which make up \textcolor{red}{\textbf{Dark Matter}?}
 \end{itemize}
Our current understanding of shows that a subset of the above set; $\{\mathbf{0}, \frac{1}{2}, 1, 2 \}\hbar$ very precisely describes only $\approx 4$\% of the entire universe. The mathematical understanding is provided by Standard Model~(SM). The SM
%\includegraphics[height=1.7cm,width=0.25\paperwidth]{THESISPLOTS/UniversePie30.jpg}
%\end{frame}
%The above particles and their nature of interaction is described mathematically using the 
is a \textit{relativistic quantum field theory} in which particles are represented as \textit{quantum fields} and their dynamics and interaction with other particles can be expressed using a mathematical function also known as a Lagrangian density, $\mathcal{L}$. This function describes fermions, bosons and their interactions with the Higgs boson to get their mass. The process of obtaining mass for fermions and bosons is fundamental to the SM and is called the \textit{Higgs Mechanism}.
Therefore, the SM can be  divided into the following sections:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{\textit{Fermions}}: All of visible matter is described using fermion fields.
\item \textbf{\textit{Interactions}}: These matter or fermion fields interact with each other through particles mediating those interactions called vector \textit{bosons} specific to either the electromagnetic, weak and strong interactions. Each interaction is as the result of a given symmetry.
\item \textbf{\textit{Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking or Higgs Mechanism}}: These matter fields have no mass. They get their mass by interacting with the Higgs field through a process known as \textit{Higgs mechanism}. Massive matter fields are allowed to mix with each other forming new states of matter.

\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Fermions}
Fermions or spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particles in the SM with their possible interactions is well described by the \textit{Dirac} equation given as:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}(\bar{\Psi},\Psi, G^{\mu}) = \bar{\Psi}\left(i \gamma^{\mu}\mathcal{D}_{\mu} - m \right)\Psi 
\end{equation}

Our current understanding favors the existence of two types of fermions: Leptons and Quarks. In the SM, these come in pairs of 3 generations but the SM itself provides no explanation for why only 3 generations.
Leptons participate in electromagnetic and weak interactions but not strong interactions while quarks can participate in all three interactions. In the SM, leptons have integer charge values and come in three families or flavors of pairs arranged in a certain mass hierarchy with the third generation being the most massive. The second and third generation flavor leptons can decay into the lower generation leptons through weak interactions. Each charged lepton of a particular flavor has its neutral pair partner known as its neutrino. For example, the pair partner of an electron is the electron neutrino. In the SM, neutrinos are described as having no mass however, numerous experiments have confirmed neutrinos to have a very tiny mass~(order of electronvolts~(eV)) and can oscillate from one flavor into another under sufficiently large distances.
\newline
Quarks also come in pairs of three flavors with the most massive being the third generation flavor capable of decaying to its lower generation flavors through electro-weak interactions. Each pair of flavor or generation of quarks consists of an "\textit{up-type}" and a "\textit{down-type}" quark. Quarks carry an electric and \textit{color} charge and as a result can also participate in strong interactions. \textit{Up-type} quarks like \texttt{up}~($u$), \texttt{charm}~($c$), \texttt{top}~($t$) have charge of $+\frac{2}{3}$ and \textit{down-type} quarks such as \texttt{down}~($d$), \texttt{strange}~($s$), \texttt{bottom}~($b$) have a charge of $-\frac{1}{3}$. Charges are expressed in units of elementary charge e.
Less fundamental particles like the proton  and neutron collectively called \textit{hadrons} are made up of quarks. The distribution of these quarks inside a hadron is modeled using a \textit{parton distribution function}~(PDF). 
%A full content of fermions in the SM and their properties can be seen in table \textbf{TABLE OF FERMIONS IN SM}.

%\begin{equation}
% TABLE AND FIGURE OF FERMIONS IN SM
%\end{equation}

One can distinguish between the so called "\texttt{Left}" from the  "\texttt{Right}" handed fermions based on the nature of their interaction with electroweak bosons.  
%Infact, the SM, does not provide any understanding of why only 3 generations of elementary particles have been discovered.
And in addition, we understand form the SM that one generation of leptons --the \texttt{electron} and the \texttt{electron neutrino}~($e$,$\nu$) and one generation of quarks --the \texttt{up-quark} and the \texttt{down quark}~($u$,$d$) provides the basis for describing all the visible matter in the universe.
\subsection*{Interactions}
The interaction between matter~(fermions) is mediated by integer spin or force-mediating particles called vector \textit{bosons}; i.e the spin of a bosonic particle can only be of the form $n\hbar$, where $n$ is a non-negative and non-null integer. The SM describes three different forces and their carriers. The electromagnetic force is described under the mathematical frame work of \textit{Quantum Electrodynamics}~(QED), the force carrier is a massless boson called the \textit{photon}~($\gamma$). The two nuclear force, the weak force which was developed later in the 1960s in a combined electro-weak framework by Sidney Glashow, Abdus Salam and Steven Weinberg~\cite{SM} have 3 massive vector bosons $W^{\pm}$, $Z^{o}$ discovered at CERN in 1983 as the force-mediators. The strong force described under the frame work of \textit{Quantum Chromodynamics}~(QCD), not unified with the other two forces, is mediated by massless \textit{gluon}~($g$).  It remains an open question whether at a much higher energy scale, all these forces unify behaving as a single force. It is also understood~(at least in theory) that \textit{gravitational} interaction is mediated by a spin-2 particle called the \textit{graviton}. There are experiments being performed searching  for gravitons.
%The table below show some the property of the force mediating particles in SM.

%\begin{equation}
% "PLEASE INSERT TABLE/DIAGRAM FOR GAUGE BOSONS HERE!"
%\end{equation}

%The current frame work of the SM was formulated with inputs from theory and results from several experiments so it in not uncommon to introduce mathematical concepts and constructs to describe the SM in an elegant manner. It is with this spirit that we will continue the rest of this section.

 At the heart of the formulation of the SM, is the concept of \textit{symmetry} and \textit{conserved quantum numbers}. Symmetry is the invariance of the dynamics~(Lagrangian density, $\mathcal{L}$), under particular transformations. In the SM, these transformations are called \textit{local} \textit{gauge} transformations(symmetry groups). %because the depend on space-time coordinates. 
The symmetries present in the SM is:

\begin{equation}
SU(3)_{C} \otimes SU(2)_{L} \otimes U(1)_{Y}
\end{equation}

%The symmetry groups describe the following parts of the SM interactions:
 %defines the strong nuclear interaction where quarks with color charge C are coupled to massless  eight( octet ) gluons in the frame work of QCD. The surprising phenomenon here is that unlike electromagnetic interactions ~(QED) where massless photons cannot interact with each other, these massless guons can interact with each since they carry color charge. There are three color charges.
$SU(3)_{C}$ is the symmetry group with quantum number \textit{color}~($C$) charge for strong interactions. There are 8 massless self interacting gluons and three different color type quarks for each quark flavor.  Anti-quarks carry opposite color charges. No unbound quark has been observed, rather, quarks exist in nature as bound states call \textit{hadrons} consisting of 2 or 3 quarks such as protons although recent experiments have observe bound states consisting of 4 quarks which remains consistent with the nature of strong interactions.
\newline
 $SU(2)_{L} \otimes U(1)_{Y}$ is the symmetry group with conserved \textit{weak isospin}~($T_{3}$)  quantum number for the electroweak interaction. There are four corresponding gauge bosons without mass $W^{1,2,3}_{\mu}, B_{\mu} $  mixing with each other to give the physical electroweak bosons; charged $W^{\pm}$ and neutral $Z^{0}$ and $\gamma$. The $W^{\pm}$ and $Z^{0}$ obtain their mass through the Higgs mechanism. These bosons couple using the "charge" of the weak interaction called weak isospin, $T_{3}$, and the hypercharge, $Y$, to matter fields. The $W^{\pm}$ only interacts with \texttt{left-handed} fermions and \texttt{right-handed} anti-fermions. This leads to a phenomenon called \textit{parity} violation. The electromagnetic charge, $Q$, is the result of a combination of the third component of the weak isospin, $T_{3}$ and the hyper charge, $Y$, through the following relation:
\begin{equation}
Q = T_{3} + \frac{Y}{2}
\end{equation}

Left handed fermions have $T_{3} = \pm \frac{1}{2}$ and are represented as \textit{multiplets } or in this case of the SM, isospin \textit{doublets},  while, right-handed fermions have have $T^{3} = 0$ and are isospin \textit{singlets}. The doublet or singlet nature of a given fermion representation in the SM is summarized in table \ref{tab:SM}.


The $SU(2)_{L} \otimes U(1)_{Y}$ group is a combination of two symmetry groups with coupling strengths $g$ and $g^{\prime}$ connected to the electric charge of each fermion as $e = g sin \theta_{w} = g^{\prime} cos \theta_{w}$.


$\theta_{w}$ is the \textit{Weinberg angle}, $sin^{2}\theta_{w} \approx 0.231$ measured from experiments.
Gauge bosons can rotate from their \textit{weak} eigen states to physically observed states using this angle.
%The physically observed gauge bosons are a rotation of the weak eigenstates involving the Weinberg angle given as:
\begin{equation}
 W^{(\pm)}_{\mu} = \frac{W^{1}_{\mu} \mp i W^{2}_{\mu}}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad \quad 
 {\begin{pmatrix} A_{\mu} \\ Z_{\mu}  \end{pmatrix} } = {\begin{pmatrix}  \cos{\theta_{w}} & \sin{\theta_{w}} \\ -\sin{\theta_{w}} & \cos{\theta_{w}}   \end{pmatrix}}  {\begin{pmatrix} B_{\mu} \\ W^{3}_{\mu} \end{pmatrix} }
\end{equation}
This angle also allows for the mixing of different quark flavors. On the contrary, according to the SM, no such mixing is possible with leptons. However, recent neutrino experiments have proven otherwise as there is mixing between different neutrino types. The mixing of quarks of different flavors is a typical interaction happening inside the core of our sun. The complete changing of all quark flavors is described by the \textit{Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa}~(CKM) 3 by 3 matrix whose elements are parameters measured from experiments alone and not predicted by the SM.
%This angle participates in an important phenomenon in SM known as quark mixing. Unfortunately in the current simplest state of SM, there are no lepton mixing(due to a global symmetry called lepton number conservation) even though the recent discovery of neutrino masses existence \cite{} hints at the possibility of such a mixing in the lepton flavour sector.
%Nevertheless, in the quark sector, it is possible for the $W^{\pm}$ to change the flavour of a given quark, for example and up-type quark u can transition to a down-type quark d. This type of transitions are referred to as Flavour Changing Charge Currents~(FCCC). However, it is not possible for $Z^{0}$ to change the flavour of a quark but also lead to small violation of parity. There is active research to discover large Flavour Changing Neutral Currents~(FCNC) from certain  weak interactions since most of these are suppressed.
%The quark mixing is entirely described using a 3 by 3 component matrix known as the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa ~(CKM) matrix given in equation below:

%\begin{equation}
%The CKM matrix
%\end{equation}
%The entire components of this matrix is measured from experiment and not derived from the SM.

%\subsection*{Quantum Chromodynamics and Parton Distribution Functions}
%\paragraph*{}
%The strong nuclear interactions described by QCD is based on the $SU(3)_{C}$ gauge group. Only quarks and gluons are involved in this interaction. Each quark can exists in three different strong "charge" called \textit{color} ( dubbed are red, green and blue ) thus forming a color triplet. Anti-quarks also carry opposite color charges. The color strength is the same for all three colors. Gluons unlike photons carry a combination of color and anti-color charge which lead to the self interaction of gluons. Gluons are not affected by Higgs mechanism thus remain massless after breaking of $SU(2)_{Y}$. Leptons carry no color and as such are color singlets thus cannot participate in strong interactions.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%% Removed at suggesting from Yuichi %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%Hadrons like protons and neutrons consists of quarks and massless gluons collectively referred to as \textit{partons}.  The strength of parton interaction is determined by the strong coupling constant~($\alpha_{S}$). The value of $\alpha_{S}$ depends on the amount of momentum transferred, $Q^{2}$, between the interacting partons. The distribution of partons inside a proton is described by a \textit{Parton Distribution Functions}~(PDF).  PDF provides the probability of finding a parton with momentum fraction $x$ of the total proton momentum $p$. PDFs are measured from electron-proton accelerator experiments such as HERA in Germany due to the difficulty of computations in Quantum Chromodynamics~(QCD). Their measurement allows for the introduction of \textit{uncertainty} in the use of PDFs in measuring other quantities such parton-parton collision cross sections. PDFs are expressed as a function of the fraction of the parton's momentum to the total proton momentum, $x = \rfrac{p}{P}$, and the momentum transfer $Q^{2}$ from a given electron or parton interacting with the parton, $f(x,Q^{2})$.
%Figure \ref{fig:pdfs} shows an example of the PDFs for a few quarks and gluons with momentum fractions  $x_{q}$ and $x_{g}$ respectively a momentum transfer of $Q^{2}$.

%\begin{center}
%\centering
%\mbox{
%\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{THESISPLOTS/PDF_TEN.png}
%\captionof{figure}{Pdfs.}
%\label{fig:pdfs}
%\end{center}

%It is imperative to know the uncertainty in the measurement of PDFs as this is usually a source of uncertainty in a related experiment.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


%\newline
%The value of the strong coupling $\alpha_{S}$ which determines the strength of the strong interaction depends on the momentum transfer $Q^{2}$ as do the coupling constants of the $SU(2) \times U(1)_{Y}$ groups.
% For large $Q^{2}$, $\alpha_{S}$ approaches zero in a process in QCD referred  to as \textit{asymptotic freedom} and the quarks are nearly free while for small values of $Q^{2}$, $\alpha_{S}$ grows large and the quarks are tightly bound. This process is also referred to as \textit{confinement}.
%Quarks are always confined to hadronic bound states called baryons or mesons consisting of three quarks or a quark and anti-quark respectively.
%\newline
%The proton is the most stable baryon. It is made up of two up quarks and one down quark such that its electric charge is 1. These are called valence quarks. It turns out that from experiments, valence quarks are not the only quarks present in a proton. Infact it is best to describe the proton as made up of \textit{partons}. Partons are quarks and gluons. 
%Inside a proton, it is possible for a gluon to radiate or split up into a quark anti-quark pair. These kind of quarks are referred to as sea quarks. All partons in a proton carry the total momentum of the proton, however during proton-proton collision in a hadron accelerator, the partons are the actual colliding particles and not the protons so it is imperative to know the momentum fraction \textit{x} of an individual parton inside a proton. The momentum fraction of a parton is expressed as a \textit{Parton Distribution Functions}~(PDFs).

% very well when performing a search for physics beyond the SM as calculating scattering \textit{cross sections} which is an experimentally observable quantity describing the probability of a particular process happening highly depends on PDFs. In addition to this, due to the PDFs, the center of mass for proton-proton collision which in actual experiment is parton-parton collision is much reduced from $\sqrt{S} = 14$ \TeV as advertised in the LHC to $\sqrt{\hat{s}} \approx 2$ \TeV and this depends on the particular partons involved in the parton-parton interaction.


%\paragraph*{}
%Without the Higgs mechanism, all the particles described so far will be massless. But experiments observe massive particles, So how do we get these particles to have mass in the SM?
%This questions remains and important one in particle physics. However in the case of the SM, we obtain mass by "manually" breaking the gauge symmetries in the SM through the addition of mass terms into the SM Lagrangian. Thus the introduction of mass terms through the Higgs mechanism breaks the local gauge invariance in the theory which describes all the above interactions.
\subsection{Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking}
It is the spontaneous breaking of:
\begin{equation}
 SU(3)_{C} \otimes SU(2)_{L} \otimes U(1)_{Y} \xRightarrow{SSB} SU(3)_C \otimes U(1)_{QED}
\end{equation}
Early attempts prior to the 1960s to constructing a gauge theory of weak interactions failed because the gauge bosons were massless while experimental evidence proved otherwise.
% Which indicated that the strength of the weak interaction can be infinite just like the electromagnetic interactions. However, theories were in complete contrast with results from experiments as weak interactions were understood to be limited to very small distances of about the scale of the nucleus. Thus these massless gauge bosons had to become massive.
\paragraph*{}
In the Higgs-Brout-Englert \cite{HIGGS} mechanism, consist of introducing an extra weak isospin complex scaler doublet $\mathbf{\phi}$.

%\begin{equation}
%INSERT HIGGS DOUBLET HERE 
%\end{equation}

%which is invariant under the gauge symmetry group $SU(2)_{L} \times U(1)_{Y} $  and has its dynamics described by the Lagrangian density:
%\begin{equation}
% HIGGS DOUBLET LAGRANGIAN
%\end{equation}
The  $SU(2)_{L} \otimes U(1)_{Y}$ symmetry is spontaneously broken into a $U(1)$ symmetry  which describes the electromagnetic interaction. Figure \ref{fig:Higgs} shows a picture of the potential of the spin $0$ complex Higgs doublet field $\mathbf{\phi}$.

%is chosen such that the potential $V \rightarrow \infty $ as $\mathbf{\Phi} \rightarrow  0 $.
%It is easily seen from the previous equation that the minimum of the potential is not longer at $\mathbf{\Phi} = 0 $ but  lies at :

The choice of the minimum value of the potential, $$|\phi_{0}| = \sqrt{\frac{-\mu^{2}}{\lambda}}  = \nu $$ where $\mu$ and $ \lambda$ are parameters, is chosen to spontaneously break the $SU(2)_{L} \otimes U(1)_{Y}$ symmetry to $U(1)$ symmetry thus giving mass to matter and gauge fields~(particles). This process is referred to as \textit{Higgs-Brout-Englert mechanism} or \textit{Higgs mechanism} for simplicity.

%With this choice of parameters settings, the potential V is itself $SU(2)_{L}$ symmetric but any other choice of ground state breaks $SU(2)_{L}$ symmetry. This is referred to as the \textit{Higgs-Brout-Englert mechanism} or \textit{Higgs mechanism} for simplicity.
%This choice of parameters of the potential V can be seen in figure below.

%\begin{equation}
%put higgs potential picture in here!
%\end{equation}

%One can then choose $\phi_{1} = \phi_{2}= \phi_{3} = 0$ and then parametrise the higgs doublet as small perturbations around the minimum as follows:
%\begin{equation}
%equation of higgs pertubations
%\end{equation}
%with $h(x), \eta_{i}(x)$ being 4 real scaler fields. Using the gauge freedom of $SU(2)_{L} \times U(1)_{Y}$ once can choose the \textit{unitarity gauge} where the kinetic terms for the fields $\eta_{i}(x)$ vanish and their with the requirement of local gauge invariance, $\eta_{i}(x)$ couple to the massless gauge bosons to be to become massive and the resulting Higgs doublet is expressed as:
%\begin{equation}
%Higgs doublet with imaginary parts removed
%\end{equation}
%With the imaginary parts removed and the  field $h(x)$ is identified as the physical real scalar Higgs field or Higgs boson.
%The ground state chosen so that the photon remains massless while the other gauge bosons including the real scalar Higgs field are massive with their masses given as:
%\begin{equation}
%Eqns of Gauge boson masses and Higgs mass
%\end{equation}
%The $Z^{0}$ mass $m_{Z}$ can also be expressed in terms of the $W^{\pm}$ mass $m_{W}$ and the Weinberg angle as:
%\begin{equation}
% Z mass to W mass equation
%\end{equation}
%Thus one can easily observe that all the effects of the W and Z bosons can be described in terms of the parameters $e$, $\theta_{w}$ and $\nu$ which can be expressed in term of Fermi constant all of which were experimentally known. Thus it is fine to say that the Higgs mechanism could predict the masses of W and Z gauge bosons which were experimentally found and measured in 1983 at LEP\cite{}.This discovery was one of the greatest triumphs of the SM.
%With the value of $\nu \approx 246$~GeV, we can then express the mass of the fermions in terms of the Yukawa coupling as ( from the Yukawa sector of the Lagrangian) :
Matter particles such as quarks and leptons, get their mass, through their interaction with the Higgs field. The amount of their obtained mass, $m_{f}$, is proportional to the strength  of their interaction or \text{Yukawa} coupling $\lambda_{f}$ with with the Higgs field. Electro-weak interaction mediating gauge bosons, $Z^{0}$ and $W^{\pm}$ obtain their masses $m_{Z}$ and  $m_{W^{\pm}}$ respectively, by engulfing or "\textit{eating}" the massless components~(Nambu-Goldstone bosons) of the complex Higgs doublet. Out of the  four scalar fields, only a physically massive Higgs boson remains.
\begin{equation}
m_{f} = \lambda_{f}\frac{\nu}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad \quad  \frac{m_{W^{\pm}}}{ m_{Z}} = \frac{\frac{1}{2}\nu g}{\frac{1}{2}\nu\sqrt{g^{2} + {g^{\prime}}^{2}}} = \cos\theta_{w}
\end{equation} 
The search for the Higgs boson was the main purpose for the construction of the LHC at CERN.  On June 04, 2012, a Higgs-like candidate particle was found whose mass $m_{H} = 125 \pm  $\GeVc which gives the parameter $\nu \approx 246$\GeV.

Figure \ref{fig:ALLSM} shows a complete summary of all the particles in the SM and their interactions.

\paragraph*{}
It is important to note that there is no fundamental reason given by the SM why there should be only one type of the Higgs field to which all fermions couple to obtain their mass nor any prediction from the SM for the choice of parameters. As we will see in other models such as supersymmetry, that, there could be more than one Higgs field.

\subsection{Decay Rate and Life Time}
Almost all particles disintegrate or \textit{decay}, most very rapidly. Collectively particles which disintegrate are said to be unstable while the few which do not are said to be stable. Those which take a long time to disintegrate are termed meta-stable or "\textit{long-lived}" particles. The length of the decay time and context will tell whether a particle is meta-stable or long-lived. The stability of a given particle is measured with respect to the age of the universe~(13.7 billion years). The only understood stable particles in nature are the \textsf{electron}(and \textsf{anti-electron})~($e$), \textsf{up}~($u$) and \textsf{down}~($d$) quarks and their anti-quarks, the \textit{photon}~($\gamma$), the lightest \text{neutrino}~($\nu_{e}$) and the \textit{graviton}. 
Particles decay by transforming from one type of particle or generation unto another either through interactions, radiation or oscillation.  This decay, in analogous to our everyday experience depends on the their interaction strength with possible particles they can decay into. For example, strongly interacting particles will decay almost immediately while weakly interacting particles will naturally take some time. However, this is not the whole story, as quantum effects will also determine the particles nature of decay.
%which is understood to be about 13.7 billion years old. 
Meta-stable particles which are composite~(bound states of elementary particles), are more unstable and easily decay into particles with smaller mass. An example of a meta-stable particle is the \textit{neutron}~(\textsf{$udd$}) which on its own, outside the atomic nucleus can remain stable for about 15 or so minutes. While, neutrons living inside some atomic neuclei can live for a period of time comparable to the age of the universe. Another meta-stable particle like the proton~(\textsf{$uud$}) seem very stable but can possibly decay after a very long period of time. It is speculated that the proton can remain stable for up to a period of about $10^{33}$ years. Atomic nuclei can also be considered as meta-stable living for about a tiny fraction of a second. Thus for all practical purposes, the proton is considered a stable particle while the neutron is considered a \textit{long-lived} particle.  It is believed that if \textit{dark matter} is made of particles then those particles  must be very, very, very long-lived with time also comparable  to or beyond  the age of the universe.

%Particle disintegration is understood as the interaction between a given particle and its daughter particle(s). This interaction could be electromagnetic, weak, strong, any pair or maybe all three types of interactions. 
The stability of a particle is determined by the properties of the particle combined with  conservation laws of a quantum number or conserved quantity like energy, spin, momentum, angular momentum and charge. Other factors may also play an important role such as phase space~(availability of lighter particles to decay into), violation of some fundamental property like \textit{strangeness} or the mediating particle usually a boson being very massive compared to the momentum transfer between the parent and the daughter particle. These laws combined with particle's properties leads to a set of rules which are (almost) entirely determine whether a particle can decay or not or at most decay very rarely.  
These set of rules can be summarized as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item All particles must and should decay to two or more particles.
\item The mass of the decaying~(parent) particle must exceed the sum of the mass  of the particles produced~(daughter particles) in its decay.
\item There must be charge conservation i.e, the total electric charge of the parent particle must equal or match the total electric charge of the daughter particles.
\item The total number of fermions or spin-1/2 particle before and after the decay must change only by an \textit{even} number.
\item The total number of quarks minus the total number of anti-quarks must not change in any decay.
\item The nature of of interaction and degree of phase space available must all be satisfied in order for any decay to take place.
\end{itemize}

The rate at which a given particle disintegrate  is known as it's \textit{decay rate}, symbolized as \textbf{$\Gamma$}. It is an experimentally measurable quantity which can also be computed in theory. A particle's decay rate $\Gamma$ can depend on the strength of a given interaction involved in the decay.As such the experimental measurement of decay rate provides access towards understanding the type of interaction involved and important parameters governing the underlying interaction or mediating particles involved in a given decay. Thus, measuring a particle's decay rate can be used as a direct access to search for other interactions beyond the known interaction and thus provide evidence for new physics. 

A single particle can decay into more than one type of particles. Provided the conditions for decay are satisfied, its decay into potential particles is possible. The decay into a specific set of particles is known as a \textit{decay channel}. Different decay channels can be quantified with respect to the overall \textit{total decay rate}  of the parent particle. This quantification is expressed as a \textit{ branching ratio~(BR)}. Thus the BR gives quantitative estimate of the possibility or probability of a parent particle decaying to specific daughter particles or through a given channel.
\newline
The inverse of a decay rate is the \textit{proper life time}, denoted as $\tau$.
\begin{equation}{\label{eq:RATE}}
  \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\end{equation}

$\tau$ is a measure of the time lived as measured in the frame of reference of the decaying particle ~(rest frame) by a particle before disintegrating.
 A convenient way to express life time is by instead of the time lived use the distance traveled by a particle before it decays denoted by  $c\tau$, where $c$ is the speed of light in vacuum and $\tau$ is the \textit{proper life time}.
This is called the \textit{proper decay length}. However, nearly impossible to measure the proper decay length inside a particle's rest frame, thus  laboratory measurements are  performed while the decaying particle is moving with some velocity, $v$ with respect to a stationary laboratory. In making these measurements,  we take into consideration this difference in motion of frames~(the moving particle frame and the stationary laboratory frame)  or relativistic effect in understanding our measurement of the decay length in the laboratory translated into the proper decay length of the particle. %The effect we need to consider is known in special relativity as \textit{time dilation} and the decay length is a measure of the distance between the position where the particle was produced to where it decayed.
The laboratory measured decay length is expressed as:
\begin{equation}{\label{eq:DECAY}}
 \vec{L} = \vec{\beta} \gamma c\tau
\end{equation}
where $\vec{\beta} = \frac{\vec{v}}{c} $ , $\vec{v}$, the velocity of the moving particle and $\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}$ is a factor accounting for the relative motion between the two frames.
Equation \ref{eq:DECAY} can also be expressed in as $\vec{L} = \frac{\vec{p}}{m}c\tau$, in terms of the particle's momentum $p$ and mass, $m$.
Thus, the larger the particle's momentum, the further is it's distance traveled from its point of production as measured in the laboratory frame. On the other hand, the larger the particle's mass, the slower it's traveling speed and hence shorter its distance traveled.

Because particle's decay rate $\Gamma$ can depend on the strength of a given interaction involved in the decay. Thus the decay length, $c\tau$  for electromagnetic interaction, can be very different to that of weak and strong interactions. The decay length for strong interactions is the shortest because of the strong nature~(coupling constant $\approx 1$) of strong interaction. The weak and electromagnetic interactions have much smaller coupling constants thus often leads to longer decay length. There are some exceptions to this due to other factors playing a key role than only the strngth of a given interaction such as the size of the available phase space and the difference in mass between the parent and the sum of the mass of the daughter particles.
%The table and graph below show the mass and decay length of SM particles and their interaction.
%\begin{equation}
% TABLE SHOWING SM particle decay rates and interactions involed as well as mass Vs decay length.
%\end{equation}
%In particle physics experiments it is very challenging to measure the  life time or decay length or a particle  by measuring the time it travels from where it was produced to where it decayed. Rather, the number of events present initially and that observed after a time period t is used to measure the lifetime of a particle. The decay rate ( or life time) of a particle is related to the number of particles observed though the equation:
 %\begin{equation}
% N(t) = N_{0}\exp\left(\frac{-t}{\tau}\right) = N_{0}\exp\left(\frac{-\Gamma t}{\hbar}\right) 
 %\end{equation}
%where \textit{N(t)} is the number of particles observed at an arbitrary time \textit{t} and $N_{0}$ is the number of particles observed at an initial time where it is assumed no particle has decayed yet usually at $ t = 0 $.
%A distribution of the observed number of particles( usually a Poisson distribution) can be plotted with time measured. The resulting distribution if fitted with a Poisson distribution faction and the parameter of the Poisson distribution function extracted  to give us the decay rate or life time of a particle.
%\newline
%Particles with large decay length or long life time are commonly referred to as \textit{Long-Live}~(LL) particles. Many models beyond the SM predict the existence of such particle. They are also understood to be prime candidates for particles making up DM.
%Before we dive into such models, it is necessary to understand in detail the decay of particles and factors which determine a particle's decay length as well as the kind of LL particles considered detectable in a multi-particle physics detector such as those at the Large Hadron Collider~(LHC) CERN pursued in this thesis.
%\paragraph*{}
%Particles described by the SM come in different types of long-lived.  First, we have the stable elementary (as we currently believe) such as the electron and neutrinos. Second, we have the meta-stable elementary such as the muon and finally the (very) long-lived composite particles such as the neutrons and protons. By referring to the different classes of particles according to their life time, we can asked the question, what properties of a particle makes it stable, meta-stable or long-lived?
%\newline
%There are three possible answers to this question:
%\begin {itemize}
%\item A particle could be the lightest state carrying a conserved quantum number and as such remain entirely stable e.g the electron and proton.
%\item The decay of a particle to another lighter particle could only be  made possible through some suppressed or effective coupling and as a result ends up being meta-stable e.g the muon
%\item If the mass of a particle is relatively close in quantity to the particle it is decaying into such that their difference in mass is quite small, the decay will be eventually suppressed. This goes by the name lack of phase space for decay e.g decay of neutron ($ n \rightarrow p + e^{-} + \bar{\nu}_{e} $). In this scenario the difference in mass between the neutron (n) and the proton (p) is $\approx 1.293$ MeV and as a result determines the type of associated particle produced in this decay as observed.
%\end{itemize}

\paragraph*{}
In order to avoid misunderstanding of what we mean by long-lived particles in this thesis, we cover mostly \textit{massive neutral meta-stable} particles  referred here as \textsf{Neutral Massive Long-Lived Particles}~(NMLLP). These are either elementary or composite neutral particles with life-time within the detectable range of a collider detector i.e few nanoseconds. In general, 
%A rather more descriptive name would be Neutral Massive Meta-Stable Particles(NMMP) since these particles are not very long-lived in the real sense but might decay into other elementary particles which for all practical purposes can be observable at collider detectors.
long lived could mean life-times from a few nanoseconds ($10^{-9}$s) to the age of the universe or equivalently from a few  $\mu$m to billions of km.
Thus, our interpretation of neutral long-lived particles will be particles whose decay length ranges from a few $\mu$m to few meters or decay length is within the detectable size of the LHC detectors and in particular electromagnetic calorimeter sector of LHC detectors.
%\newline
%We have restricted ourselves to electromagnetic (local U(1) gauge symmetry) neutral particles as their charge counterparts can be studied using conventional magnetic spectrometer and ionization methods as shown in this studies for Heavy Stable Charge Particles (HSCP).



\subsection{Limitations Of the Standard Model}
The SM~(Glashow, 1961; Weinberg, 1967; Salam, 1968) describes almost entirely all of the observed phenomena and fundamental particles of nature with unmatched precision.
However, more concerning our universe is yet to be understood. A few of this include:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{General Formalism} \mbox{}\\ Many important parameters in the SM like the Weinberg angle and the CKM matrix elements for example cannot not be derived within the theory but rather measured or provided by experiment. This is not a desirable quality for a self-sufficient and consistent theoretical description of nature. The SM cannot account for the multiplet structure of fields as the basic field representation in the SM and why there are only three observed generations of elementary particles. Neutrinos according to the SM are described as massless neutral spin-1/2 particles, however experiments involving neutrino oscillations observed neutrinos to have a finite tiny mass around eV range. The Electro-weak symmetry breaking which is central to the SM is not very well understood as the SM does not provide an explanation of whether there are more than one spin-0 boson responsible for particles masses or not.

\item \textbf{Astrophysical} \mbox{}\\
Why is the universe made of so much matter and not anti-matter? If the Big Bang theory which describes the creation and existence of the universe is assumed to be the correct theory, then matter and anti-matter should be observed in equal composition. However, astrophysical measurements of the ratio of barons to anti-baryons referred as the \textit{Baryon asymmetry ratio} shows that there is more matter than anti-matter in the universe. Where is all the expected anti-matter? This could fairly be explained through charge-parity violation in weak interactions of the SM but this contribution is not enough to explain the entire observed baryonic matter discrepancy. Observations through \textit{Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation}~(BAO) or \textit{Cosmic Microwave Background}~(CMB) and the \textit{Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe}~(WMAP) results indicate the presence of excess matter which does not interact with light called Dark Matter~(DM) and Dark Energy~(DE) responsible for an increase energy density causing rapid accelerated expansion of the universe. These observations cannot be explained using the current SM.
\item \textbf{Theory} \mbox{}\\
From a theoretical standpoint, the SM is considered a low energy theory of a much deeper underlying theory describing nature(i.e the SM is an effective field theory). This is because the SM description of nature does not include gravitational interactions. In addition, the SM coupling constants vary with energy. This begs the question; is there  a much higher energy scale where all these couplings behaves as single more fundamental single coupling constant~(Unification of forces)?. Other theories like \textit{Supersymmetry} which is an extension of the SM towards a higher energy scale, show the possibility of unifying the known coupling constants or forces at \textit{Grand Unified Theories}~(GUT) energy scale which is about $\approx 10^{15}$ \GeV.

\item \textbf{Mass Hierarchy or Naturalness} \mbox{}\\
The observed masses  for fundamental particles ranges from neutrino masses of a few eV to the \textsf{top} particle's mass of 173~\GeV. The SM only accounts for how particles obtain their mass through their interaction with a scalar field~(spin-0), the Higgs boson. However, the experimental observation of this particles mass hierarchy is not understood. Infact according to the SM, neutrinos have no mass. 
From an energy scale point of view, this lack of our understand also known as the \textit{hierarchy} "\textit{problem}" can be posed as follows; why do experiments observed such a huge energy gap between the electro-weak symmetry breaking energy scale~( $\approx 246$~\GeV) and the Planck energy scale~(reduced Planck mass, $M_{p} = 10^{18}$~\GeV)?
A consequence of this, is on the experimentally observed value of the mass of the Higgs boson, $\approx 125$~\GeV. The Higg's mass is stable and does not grow to very large values as the energy scale increases towards $M_{p}$ as one would expect from theoretical calculations.  \textit{Supersymmetry}, an extension of the SM, allowing for the possibility of more than a single Higgs boson, provides an explanation for why the  Higg's mass remains stable at all energy scale. Its main idea, is the existence of fundamental new particles with masses within the weak and gravity energy scale and through their interaction with the higgs keeps its mass stable. We will see more of this in the next section.
\end{itemize}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Beyond Standard Model Physics}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The SM predictions of the value of the Higgs boson's mass recommend additional contributions from \textit{quantum fluctuations}~(higher order or loop corrections) which are very large~(can as well be infinite). However, the observed experimentally measured value of the Higgs mass~($m_{H} \approx 125$~\GeV). This unobserved large corrections to the experimentally measured value requires some understanding. A possible explanation is that these various contributions cancel on average producing a net zero effect on the true Higgs mass such that the physically observed mass is as measured. If such cancellation is a true phenomenon in nature, then it is only logical to inquire the origin of this cancellations. Obviously this cannot be understood within the frame work of the SM. 

Consequently, theories beyond the SM like \textit{supersymmetry} provide a natural understanding of how these various contributions cancel on average arriving at the physically observed and measured Higgs mass. To expand further, the mass of a particle can be expressed as 
\begin{equation}
 m^{2}_{\mbox{physical}} = m^{2}_{\mbox{bare}} + \delta m^{2}_{1}
\end{equation}

where $m^{2}_{\mbox{physical}}$ is the physically measured mass of the Higgs boson,  $m^{2}_{\mbox{bare}}$ is the true  universe given mass of the particle which cannot be calculated or measured. $\delta m^{2}_{1}$ are corrections from quantum fluctuations to the true mass which can be calculated. Using the measured mass and the calculated  quantum corrections, one can obtain the true Higgs mass. These contributions from quantum fluctuations can arise from both bosons and fermions. Since the Higgs boson can interact~(by coupling) with every particle through interactions of the general form $\lambda_{f}H\bar{f}f$ for fermions and $\lambda_{S}|H|^{2}S^{2}$ for scalar or bosons;  with $\lambda_{f}$ and $\lambda_{S}$ representing the coupling constants which need not be equal. The Feynman diagrams in \ref{fig:Hmass} represents a few of such quantum fluctuations with both fermion and boson contributions computed as:

\begin{center}
%\centering
%\mbox{
\includegraphics[height=5cm,width=0.5\linewidth]{THESISPLOTS/Higgs_Hirrachy_Problem.png}
\captionof{figure}{Higgs self energy diagrams showing how the higgs boson mass is computed from both Higgs field and supersymmetric partner particle contributions.}
\label{fig:Hmass}
\end{center}

\begin{equation}
\delta m^{2}_{1,f} = \frac{1}{16\pi^{2}}|\lambda_{f}|^{2}\left(-2\Lambda^{2} + 6m^{2}_{f}\ln\left(\frac{\Lambda}{m_{f}}\right) + ...\right) 
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\delta m^{2}_{1,S} = \frac{1}{16\pi^{2}}|\lambda_{S}|^{2}\left(\Lambda^{2} - 2m^{2}_{S}\ln\left(\frac{\Lambda}{m_{S}}\right) + ...\right) 
\end{equation}
$\Lambda$ is some \textit{cut-off} energy scale where a another kind of physics interaction like gravity at a much higher energy scale is needed to regulate the low energy behavior of the SM. $\Lambda$ could be the reduced Planck scale(~ $10^{18}$~\GeV).  A quick observation from this calculations is that; first, corrections to the higgs bare mass, $m^{2}_{\mbox{bare}}$ are not proportional to the Higgs mass.
%( in other cases like as is the case with other SM particles like the electron\cite{}.
Second, these corrections are of the order of $\approx 10^{36}~\GeV^{2}$  bringing positive and negative contributions from fermions or scalar bosons respectively.
Even with these corrections to the true Higgs mass, the measured~(physical) Higgs mass squared, $m^{2}_{H,\mbox{physical}}$, is of the order $\approx 10^{4}~\GeV^{2}$.
Since the true Higgs mass, $m^{2}_{H,\mbox{bare}}$, is never measured or known, an agreement between these quantum fluctuation contributions and physical Higgs mass is realized  if only the true Higgs mass, $m^{2}_{H,\mbox{bare}}$,  is \textit{fine-tuned} with a precision of about 1 in $10^{17}$. This enormous fine-tuning is considered a fundamental issue of not enough understanding of the Higgs mechanism of the SM and is considered \textit{unnatural}. 
%The fact that, among the numerous SM predictions, no other scalar particle except the possible Higgs boson candidate has been observed so far, further makes such a fine-tuning difficult to understood. 
On the other hand, in suppersymmetry, the fermion one loop quantum correction which comes with an opposite sign to the scalar quantum fluctuation corrections and $\lambda_{f} = \lambda_{S}$ ,there is a complete  cancellation and this discrepancy of the unobserved effects of these quantum fluctuations to the $m^{2}_{H,\mbox{bare}}$ in the $m^{2}_{H,\mbox{physical}}$ is understood. 
% Another interpretation of this issue is through the question of why there is so much difference in energy scale between the electroweak scale \textit{O}(100~\GeV) and the Planck energy scale \textit{O}($10^{19}$~\GeV) where gravity effects to particle interaction becomes significant?. This is referred to as the \textit{Hierarchy problem} stated above as one of the motivation to go beyond SM.
\paragraph*{}
In addition to explaining the origin of this perceived \textit{fine-tuning} issue, supersymmetry also provides a natural framework for the unification of fundamental forces, not possible in the SM.
If the SM is believed to be an incomplete and low energy description of nature of a possible parent and more fundamental theory like supersymmetry, then one would expect that the symmetry groups of the SM be a subset of some larger parent group, $\mathcal{G}$; i.e $\displaystyle{SU(3)_{C} \otimes SU(2)_{L} \otimes U(1)_{Y} \subset \mathcal{G}}$.
%It is believed that at a higher energy scale since SM seems to be describing the  behavior of some parent theory, the electromagnetic, weak and strong interactions all become one interaction just as the electromagnetic and weak interaction unified into the electro-weak interaction as the electro-weak energy scale $\approx 100$~\GeV. i.e
%$\mathcal{G}$ is some larger symmetry group. In SM, this does not happen at any higher energy scale. However, in 
In suppersymmetry, This unification of forces or couplings of electromagnetic, weak and strong interactions occur at the \textit{Grand Unified Energy}~(GUT) energy scale of $\approx 10^{15}$~\GeV \cite{SM}.
%This effect can be seen in the following figures as taken from \cite{}.

\subsection{Supersymmetry}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
In relativistic Quantum Field Theory~(QFT), the idea of symmetry or group theory is used to provide a better understanding of fundamental particles and their properties. These symmetries belong to two broad categories: space-time symmetries known as Poincar\'{e}(i.e rotation and translation) symmetries and gauge ( such as $SU(3)_{C}\otimes SU(2)_{L}\otimes U(1)_{Y}$ with quantum numbers; color, weak and hypercharge respectively of the SM) symmetries. With the SM viewed as a low energy version of a more large and unified theory,  
%that all fundamental forces including gravity could be unified 
%In a quest to include gravitational interaction along with all the other forces of nature into a unique frame work called unification, 
it was believed that combining these two classes of symmetries into one big class of symmetry could lead the way towards the development of this unified theory. However, Coleman and Mandula\cite{SUSY}, in their so-called "\textit{no-go}" theorem in 1967  showed that pursuing the approach of \textit{direct product} of the two super groups  was not possible. %Thus these two class of symmetries cannot be combined into a bigger parent symmetry. 
The challenge was finding a scenario where the generators of both space-time $P^{\mu}$, $M^{\mu\nu} $  and gauge groups $T^{a}$, do not commute with each other; i.e $ \left[M^{\mu\nu}, T^{a}\right] \neq 0$ and yet remains a direct product of both symmetry groups, considering that the direct product of these groups do commute; i.e
%the generators of these groups; $P^{\mu}, M^{\mu\nu}$ and $T^{a}$ corresponding to these symmetries have a direct product;  Poincar\'{e} $\times$Gauge group, for which
$ \left[P^{\mu}, T^{a}\right] = \left[M^{\mu\nu}, T^{a}\right] = 0$. 
\newline
This \textit{no-go} theorem prevents the possibility of finding a parent group where its generators are constructed from \textit{Lorentz} tensors. Thus, only symmetries  generated from \textit{spinoral}~(particle's spin) charges instead of \textit{tensorial}~(space-time) charges were possible. In 1975, Haag, Lapuszanski and Sohnius \cite{MSUSY} found such a group theorem known as the \textit{Haag-Lapuszanski-Sohnius} theorem with its corresponding generator algebra called the \textit{Lie-superalgebra} or the \textit{supersymmetry algebra}.  This supersymmetry algebra extended the commutative aspect of the Poincar\'{e} algebra to include \textit{anticommuting} symmetry generators.
\newline
\textit{Lie-superalgebra} generators, $\mathrm{Q}_{i}$, $i = 1,...,\mathrm{N}$, where $\mathrm{N}$ is the number of supersymmetry generators, anti-cummute with the group and space-time generators.  % as shown in equation \ref{eq:SUSYGEN}. 
Supersymmetry is a well developed and advanced branch in theoretical physics where the number of supersymmetry generators can be any number. However, this thesis only considers the case where there is only one generator of supersymmetry; i.e $\mathrm{N} = 1$. This is the minimal  version of supersymmetry. 
 The generators $\mathrm{Q_{1}} \equiv \mathrm{Q^{\alpha}}$, where $\alpha=1,2$ is labeling \textit{Weyl or two spinor} components,  and its hermitian conjugate, $\mathrm{\bar{Q}_{\alpha}}$, must satisfy the relations given in equation \ref{eq:SUSYGEN}.
\begin{eqnarray}{\label{eq:SUSYGEN}}             
\left\lbrace\mathrm{Q_{\alpha}}, \mathrm{\bar{Q}_{\beta}}\right\rbrace =  2\left(\gamma^{\mu}\right)_{\alpha\beta}P^{\mu}, &
\left[\mathrm{Q_{\alpha}},P^{\mu}\right] = 0, &
\left[\mathrm{Q_{\alpha}}, M^{\mu\nu}\right] =\frac{1}{2}\left(\Sigma^{\mu\nu}\right)_{\alpha}^{\beta}\mathrm{Q_{\beta}}
\end{eqnarray}

%$\gamma^{\mu}$ is define such that 
Where $\left\lbrace \gamma^{\mu}, \gamma^{\nu}\right\rbrace = 2\mathrm{g^{\mu\nu}}$ and  $\Sigma^{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}\left[\gamma^{\mu},\gamma^{\nu}\right]$ 
. %and $\mathrm{\bar{Q}_{\alpha}}$ is the Hermitian conjugate to $\mathrm{Q}$.
These relations in equation \ref{eq:SUSYGEN} reveal two very fundamental consequences of supersymmetry:
\begin{itemize}
\item  Particles in a given state~(\textit{supermultiplet}) have the same mass but differ in their spin by half $\hbar$ unit.
\item In every irreducible representation of supersymmetry, there is an equal number of fermionic and bosonic degrees of freedom. 
\end{itemize}
Thus, supersymmetry is the symmetry which transforms particles from one spin into another with the same mass. As a consequence, supersymmetry generators transform fermions into bosons and bosons into fermions with the same mass.
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathrm{Q}|\textbf{Fermion}\rangle =|\textbf{Boson}\rangle,    &
\mathrm{Q}|\textbf{Boson}\rangle  =|\textbf{Fermion} \rangle 
\end{eqnarray}
This reveals that, in supersymmetry, every particle has a supersymmetric partner with the same mass lying in the same representation or supermultiplets.
% chosen such that every SM particle with spin 0,$\frac{1}{2}$, 1, 2 have a partner with spin $\frac{1}{2}$,0,$\frac{1}{2}$,$\frac{3}{2}$ respectively in the same supermultiplets.
These supermultiplets are either \textit{Chiral}, \textit{Vector} or \textit{Gravity} multiplets. The minimal supersymmetric extension of SM uses Chiral and Vector supermultiplets. 
The following table shows the different supermultiplets as encountered in supersymmetry.

In addition to an algebraic approach to supersymmetry described so far, in order to build models~(supersymmetric Lagrangians) and make predictions, we return to the idea of fields as used in supersymmetry. Supersymmetric fields are called \textit{superfields}~( proposed and realized by Abdus Salam and Strathdee \cite{SALAM, SUSYBOOK}) are fields defined on a superspace; an ordinary Minkowski space-time, $x^{\mu}$ and four anti-commuting \textit{Grassmann} numbers, $\theta$. More on this can be seen in  \cite{SUSYBOOK}.
These superfields are operator-valued functions, \textbf{$\Phi$}, on a superspace represented by, \textbf{$\Phi\left(x^{\mu},\theta,\bar{\theta}\right)$}.
Its components consist of ordinary scalar fields~(real or complex), Lorentz vector fields and Left-handed or Right-Handed Weyl(2 degrees of freedom) spinor fields, \textbf{$\Phi\left(x^{\mu},\theta,\bar{\theta}\right) \supset (\phi, \psi, A_{\mu}, F)$}.
Table \ref{tab:SUSYF} shows an example of the components which make up the  superfield~( or supermultiplets) with each component representing a SM particle and its super partner with the same mass. Only the Chiral and Vector  superfields are used in constructing the minimal supersymmetric version of standard model

\subsection{Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model}
The Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model~(MSSM) is an extension of the SM to include supersymmetric particles. Supersymmetric particles have almost the same name as SM particles with the only difference being the addition of an s in front of the SM particles's name e.g a \textit{selectron} is the supersymmetric particle of and electron, \textit{squarks} are the supersymmetric particles of SM quarks. There are exceptions to this nomenclature. In order for supersymmetry~(SUSY) predictions to be agreement with observations from experiments, SUSY must be realized as a broken symmetry in nature.
%As a result, the already 19 free parameters of the SM is increased with more additional 105 free parameters. These are a lot of parameters for any fundamental theory describing elementary particle  interactions and thus undermines its predictive power. Thus, a generic or parent theory must be preferred in which the number of free parameters for the theory to predict is much reduced. Through this way, it is much easier to study the  phenomenological aspect of the theory. 
The type is which SUSY is broken allows for different models with different phenomenology to be expected from predictions made by these models. If the SUSY breaking is communicated through gravitational interaction, such class of models are called \textit{Gravity Breaking SUSY Models}~(mSUGRA) with instead of the 19 fundamental parameters as in the SM, only 6 parameters are needed to explain all our observed particle phenomenology. If instead SUSY breaking is purely  because of gauge interactions, this class of models are \textit{Gauge Mediated Supersymmetry Breaking}~(GMSB) models with only 5 fundamental parameters. Other SUSY models like \text{Anomalous Supersymmetry Breaking}~(ASB) having 6 parameters have been proposed.
\newline
This thesis only discusses GMSB models as they have favorable theoretical benefits like being flavor blind as well as predict the existence of long lived particles which opens up a whole new technique to search for supersymmetric particles in hadron collider or related particle physics experiments.
Table \ref{tab:SUSYP} and \ref{tab:SUSYG} shows SM particles and their supersymmetric counterparts as understood through the MSSM framework.

In SUSY, the superpotential which allows for SUSY breaking defines the phenomenology and particle mass spectrum in any given SUSY model.
In MSSM, this superpotential is given as seen in eqn \ref{eq:SUSYEQ}.
\begin{align}{\label{eq:SUSYEQ}}
W_{\mbox{mssm}} = \bar{u}\mathbf{y_{u}}\mathcal{Q}H_{u}   -   \bar{d}\mathbf{y_{d}}\mathcal{Q}H_{d}   -  \bar{e}\mathbf{y_{e}}\mathcal{L}H_{d}  -  \mu H_{d}H_{u}
\end{align}
Where the objects $H_{u}$, $H_{d}$, $\mathcal{Q}$, $\mathcal{L}$, $\bar{u}$, $\bar{d}$, $\bar{e}$ are Chiral superfields corresponding to the Chiral supermultiplets given in table \ref{tab:SUSYF} above.
The dimensionless couplings $\mathbf{y_{u}}$,$\mathbf{y_{d}}$,$\mathbf{y_{e}}$ are $3 \times 3$ matrices known as the Yukawa couplings. rather than a single Higgs double as in  the SM, SUSY breaking allows for two Higgs double to be present; $H_{u}$ and $H_{d}$ to provide masses to \textsf{up}-type and \textsf{down}-type quarks and leptons. The superpartners of these Higgs particles which are fermions and those of the gauge bosons called \textit{gauginos} mix to produce new neutral and charged fermions called \textit{Neutralinos} and \textit{Charginos} respectively.
\paragraph*{R-Parity Symmetry}\mbox{}\\
In MSSM, a combination of baryon~(B) and lepton number~(L) symmetries is combined to give a fundamental symmetry called  \textit{Matter Parity} or \textit{R-Parity}.
From a multiplicative combination of B and L numbers, we get R-parity expressed as:
\begin{align}
R_{P} = \left(-1\right)^{3(B-L) + 2S}
\end{align} 
where $S$ is the spin of the particle.
R-parity is a conserved quantum number which originates from a discrete $Z_{2}$-symmetry \cite{SM}. R-parity symmetry commutes with supersymmetry. Therefore, particles in a given supermultiplet do not have the same R parity.
SM particles like quarks have an even parity $R_{P} = 1$ while SUSY particles like squarks have odd parity $R_{P} = -1$.
R-parity has important phenomenological consequences such as the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item In the decay of SUSY particles, the lightest SUSY particle~(LSP) have odd parity $R_{P} =-1$ and thus are considered absolutely stable. If in addition to being stable, the LSP is neutral an interacts only very weakly with ordinary matter, then it is a good candidate for non-baryonic dark matter as required by cosmology\cite{LSPDM}.
\item Every SUSY particle produced which is not the LSP, will eventually decay into the LSP or an odd number of LSPs.
\item SUSY particles can only be produced in pairs in a collider experiment.
\end{itemize}
Thus in generic SUSY models with minimal particle content, where the superpontential include terms which violate Lepton~(L) and baryon~(B) numbers; R-parity conservation can be imposed giving rise to \textit{R-parity Conserving}~(RPC) models with the LSP stable while R-parity can be violated resulting to \textit{R-parity Violating}~(RPV) models where the LSP is unstable and decays to SM particles.
\newline
RPC models are those discussed in this thesis as our search is motivated towards the search for neutral stable particles as possible candidates particles for dark matter~(DM).
\paragraph*{•}
If SUSY is a theory which describes nature, then its prediction of components within the same supermultiplets with the same mass, i.e $m_{B}= m_{F}$ is not realistic, since  experiments are yet to find a selectron~(SUSY partner of electron) with a mass of 0.512\MeV for example. Therefore, SUSY must be realized through a spontaneously broken way. Spontaneous Supersymmetry Breaking~(SSB) means the lowest energy state or vacuum expectation value of a scalar field~(or auxiliary field as is the case with SUSY) must be non-zero. The type of breaking  determines the phenomenology of any given model. We focus on models with gauge interactions responsible for communicating SUSY breaking from a higher energy level to our observable collider experiments energy levels. Gauge Mediated SUSY breaking models~(GMBS) can be Pure, General or minimal Gauge Mediation~(GGM)depending on the model parameters.
The presence of the hadron collider in CERN, has encouraged the development of SUSY models whose predictions are about a few \TeV for the mass range of some of these SUSY particles and also the energy scale which the most powerful particle colliders can probe for new particles. These kind of models are called Soft SUSY Breaking models. We would focus on such models in particular the \textit{Snowmass Point and Slopes}~(SPS8) \cite{SUSY} models with phenomenology within the reach of the LHC. Soft breaking mean the SUSY breaking terms in the SUSY potential~(eqn \ref{eq:SUSYEQ}) consists of only masses and terms whose couplings have positive mass dimension. This ensures the existence of sparticles with masses around a few \TeV where they can possibly be produced at current particle colliders such as the large hadron collider~(LHC).
\subsection{Soft Supersymmetry Breaking}
Soft SUSY breaking is such that the spontaneous breaking must be caused by couplings with positive mass dimension and not dimensionless coupling. This allows for the alredy observed hierarchy between the Electro-Weak energy scale of $\approx 100$\GeV and the reduced Planck energy scale $ \approx 10^{18}$\GeV .
The Lagrangian for soft SUSY breaking terms  can be written as thus:
\begin{align}
\mathcal{L}^{\mbox{mssm}}_{\mbox{soft}} &= -\frac{1}{2}\left( M_{3}\tilde{g}\tilde{g} + M_{2}\tilde{W}\tilde{W} + M_{1}\tilde{B}\tilde{B}\right) + c.c + \cdots \\
& -\left(a_{u}\tilde{\bar{u}}\tilde{Q}H_{u} - a_{d}\tilde{\bar{d}}\tilde{Q}H_{d} - a_{e}\tilde{\bar{e}}\tilde{L}H_{d} + c.c \right)
\end{align}
%&- m^{2}_{H_{u}}H^{*}_{u}H_{u} - m^{2}_{H_{d}}H^{*}_{d}H_{d} - \left( bH_{u}H_{d} + c.c. \right) \\
%&- m^{2}_{Q}\tilde{Q}^{+}\tilde{Q} - m^{2}_{L}\tilde{L}^{+}\tilde{L} - m^{2}_{\bar{u}}\tilde{\bar{u}}^{+}\tilde{u}-m^{2}_{\bar{d}}\tilde{\bar{d}}^{+}\tilde{d} -m^{2}_{\bar{e}}\tilde{\bar{e}}^{+}\tilde{e}\\


where $M_{1}$, $M_{2}$ and $M_{3}$ are the superpartners of the gauge bosons of the SM symmetry group. They are referred to as the \textit{Bino}~($\tilde{B}$), \textit{Wino}~($\tilde{W}$) and \textit{gluinos}~(8 gluinos because there are 8 gluons in the SM). I have intentionally omitted  scalar mass terms in this Lagrangian, if interested in the rest of the terms see \cite{SM}.

The SUSY particle mass spectrum for particles within the SPS8 and GGM benchmark models framework after SSB is shown in figure \ref{fig:spectra}.

In summary, MSSM in addition to SM particles, contains new particles whose spin~(S) differ from their SM counterparts by half-integer. Bosons~(fermions) in the SM have superpartners which are fermions~(bosons) respectively.
The superpartners of SM fermions are scalars called \textit{sfermions}~($\tilde{l}$), sneutrinos~($\tilde{\nu}$) and squarks~($\tilde{q}$) while \textit{gluinos}~{$\tilde{g}$) being fermions are the superpartners of the massless gauge bosons of strong interaction, gluons. The scalar Higgs~(2 needed) bosons and the vector gauge bosons of Electro-Weak interaction have fermionic superpartners called \textit{higgsinos}, \textit{Winos} and \textit{Binos}. These can mix to form a pair of mass eigenstates called \textit{charginos}~($\tilde{\chi}^{\pm}_{j}, j=1,2$) i.e 
$\tilde{\chi}^{\pm}_{1,2}$ is a from mixing $\tilde{W}^{+}, \tilde{W}^{-}, \tilde{H}^{+}, \tilde{H}^{-} $ and a quartet of mass  eigenstates called \textit{neutralinos}~($\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{i}, i=1,...,4$), i.e $\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1-4}$ is from mixing $\tilde{B}^{\circ}, \tilde{W}^{\circ}, \tilde{h}^{\circ}, \tilde{H}^{\circ} $.

\subsection{Gauge Mediated Supersymmetry Breaking and Phenomenology}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{General Model}
\paragraph*{•}
Constructing a SUSY model requires that the model has gauge group describing the nature of particle interaction, a superpotential, and since the SUSY prediction of equal masses of boson and fermions is not observable, one must provide explicitly the method for spontaneously breaking supersymmetry. We have in the MSSM scenario seen the gauge groups to be exactly those of the SM, the superpontential with soft terms, however, we are yet to understand how supersymmetry is broken. SUSY breaking means that we find the lowest energy state for which the vacuum expectation values of the  SUSY generators $\mathrm{Q}_{\alpha} \ket 0 \neq 0$ or $\bar{\mathrm{Q}}_{\alpha}\ket 0 \neq 0$. Since one can always express the Hamiltonian of the system, $\mathrm{H}$ in terms of the SUSY generators, SUSY breaking can also be equally expressed as $\mathrm{H}\ket 0 \neq 0$. Neglecting spacetime-dependent effects and condensates, SUSY breaking is equivallently expressed as $\mathrm{V}\ket 0 \neq 0$, where $\mathrm{V}$ is the standard superpontential expressed in terms of the $\mathrm{F}$ and $\mathrm{D}$ terms. Thus, spontaneously breaking SUSY is equivalent to finding superpotentials for which neither $\mathrm{F}$ nor $\mathrm{D}$ terms simultaneously vanish in the lowest energy state. Suoerpotentials with non vanishing $\mathrm{F}$ terms are called  \textit{O'Raifeartaigh} or $\mathrm{F}$-term SUSY breaking models while those with nonvanishing $\mathrm{D}$ terms are called \textit{Fayet-Illiopoulus} or $\mathrm{D}$-term SUSY breaking models. Since in GMSB models, it is the $\mathrm{F}$ term which has a non-vanishing lowest energy state expectation value or vacuum expectation, this thesis only considers  \textit{O'Raifeartaigh} SUSY breaking models.
\newline
In GMSB models, this superpotential is termed the \textit{Hidden Sector}~(hidden because it couples only indirectly and very weakly to our "observable sector" of SM particles and their superpartners) and it is its dynamics which spontaneously breaks supersymmetry. The nature of this breaking is not relevant for phenomenology but rather the "\textit{mediators}" which communicate the effects of this breaking to the superpartners of the SM particles. Therefore, these mediators or agents must couple to this "Hidden Sector" as well as the "observable sector".
This \textit{Messenger fields} in GMSB, have the usual SM gauge interactions  and through loops couple with the SM superpartners. As a result MSSM particles~(gauginos and sfermions) obtain SUSY breaking masses referred to as \textit{soft terms} through loop level interactions. This procedure allows for the observed mass and energy scale hierarchy is maintained. The mass of these messenger fields, $\displaystyle{\mathrm{M}_{\mbox{mess}}}$, along with $\left\langle\mathrm{F}\right\rangle$  defines the energy scale at which supersymmetry breaking is felt at the MSSM energy scale. If $\displaystyle{\mathrm{M}_{mess} \ll \mathrm{M}_{\mbox{Planck}}}$, $\mathrm{M}_{\mbox{Planck}} \approx 10^{19}$\GeV, then supersymmetry breaking occurs at a much lower energy scale instead at the Planck energy scale where gravitational interactions become very significant and the effects of the breaking is first felt by these Messenger fields and later communicated to the observable sector through SM gauge interactions.
In terms of energy scales, the picture is such that spontaneous supersymmetry breaking occurs at an energy scale, $\left\langle\mathrm{F}\right\rangle$ which we denote as $\mathbf{F}$, for simplicity. This energy scale defines the mass, as seen in equation \ref{eq:GMass}, of the \textit{gravitino} which is the supersymmetric partner of gravity mediating particle, the \textit{graviton}. The gravitino has the same quantum number as the Nambu-Goldstone particle, the massless neutral Weyl fermion, the \textit{goldstino}, originating from supersymmetry breaking. 
\begin{equation}{\label{eq:GMass}}
 m_{3/2} = \frac{\mathbf{F}}{{\sqrt{3}\mathrm{M}_{Pl}}}
\end{equation}
where $\displaystyle{\mathrm{M}_{Pl} = 1.3 \times 10^{19}}$~GeV.

In GMSB models, the energy scale for which supersymmetry breaking is transmitted to the Hidden sector, $\mathbf{F}_{s}$ might not be the same as the original or fundamental sypersymmetry breaking energy scale, $\mathbf{F}$. If $\displaystyle{\mathbf{F}_{s} < \mathbf{F}}$ then the interaction between the hidden sector and the fundamental SUSY breaking is weak interaction and if $\displaystyle{\mathbf{F}_{s} \approx \mathbf{F}}$ and the interaction is strong.  It is necessary that this interaction is weak, as in this case GMSB models do not surfer from flavor violating interactions which are not observed in nature.
%The induced SUSY breaking scale in the hidden sector ${\mathrm{F}}_{S}$ and the mass of the messenger particles  defines the mass spectrum of the particles in the MSSM sector.
The consequences of this is that one would no longer expect the mass of the gravitino $m_{3/2}$ to be given as in equation \ref{eq:GMass} but rather suppressed by $\mathrm{M}_{\mbox{mess}}/\mathrm{M}_{Pl}$ in GMSB models. In this mass spectrum scenario, the gravitino mass can be varied to a very small value only bounded by cosmological results, thus making it the lightest supersymmetric particle~(LSP). Spanning the gravitino mass is expressed as a fundamental parameter in GMSB modles, $C_{grav}$ which directly determines the lifetime of the next-to-lightest supersymmetry sparticle  decaying to the gravitino. We will see more of this ahead. Thus the parameters $\mathbf{F}_{s}$ and  $\mathrm{M}_{\mbox{mess}}$, determines the masses of the gauginos and sfermions of the MSSB in GMSB models.
\newline
A minimal GMSB model is one where the messenger sector consists of chiral supermultiplets of leptons and quark with the same quantum numbers $SU(3)_{C}\times SU(2)_{L}\times U(1)_{Y}$ as the SM gauge groups. That is, the messenger fields belong to some $SU(5)$ gauge group. The representations of these messengers fields are given in equation \ref{eq:MESS}.
\begin{align}{\label{eq:MESS}}
\tilde{\ell} \sim (1,2,1) \quad \tilde{\ell^{\prime}} \sim (1, 2^{\star}, -1) \\
\tilde{q} \sim (3,1,-\frac{2}{3}) \quad \tilde{q}^{\prime} \sim (3^{\star}, 1, \frac{2}{3} )
\end{align}
These messenger fields, via a superpotential as in equation \ref{eq:WMESS} of a gauge singlet chiral supermultiplet $\mathrm{S}$, couple with an $\mathrm{F}$-term as in the O'Raifeartaigh model \cite{SM}. 
\begin{equation}{\label{eq:WMESS}}
W_{\mbox{mess}} = \lambda_{\ell}\mathrm{S}\tilde{q}\tilde{q}^{\prime} + \lambda_{q}\mathrm{S}\tilde{\ell}\tilde{\ell^{\prime}}
\end{equation}
We thus obtain SUSY breaking by allowing vacuum expectation values~(VEV) for both $\mathrm{S}$ and its auxiliary component $\mathrm{F}$ term as $\left\langle \mathrm{S} \right\rangle$ and $\left\langle \mathrm{F}_{s} \right\rangle = \mathbf{F}_{s}$, where the $\mathbf{F}_{s}$ does not have to coincided with $\mathbf{F}$ as mentioned earlier. The parameter representing this non equivalence,$C_{grav}$ is defined as shown in equation \ref{eq:CGRAV}. It is one of the fundamental parameters in GMSB models responsible for the lifetime of NLSP particle.
\begin{equation}{\label{eq:CGRAV}}
\mathbf{F} = C_{grav}\cdot\mathbf{F}_{s}
\end{equation}
This equation indicates that the non-zero VEV for the $\mathrm{F}$ term is responsible for fundamental SUSY breaking which is transferred to the messenger particles through radiative interactions as $C_{grav}$ is a dimensionless parameter.
Leptons and fermions masses(\ref{eq:MMass}) of the messenger particles together with their scalar superpartners are obtained from diagonalizing the mass matrix.
\begin{align}{\label{eq:MMass}}
m^{2}_{\tilde{\ell}\tilde{\ell^{\prime}}} &= |\lambda_{\ell}\left\langle \mathrm{S} \right\rangle|^{2}, \quad \quad  m^{2}_{\tilde{\ell}_{\mbox{scalars}}} = |\lambda_{\ell}\left\langle \mathrm{S} \right\rangle|^{2} \pm |\lambda_{\ell}\left\langle \mathrm{F_{s}} \right\rangle |
\\
m^{2}_{\tilde{q}\tilde{q^{\prime}}} &= |\lambda_{q}\left\langle \mathrm{S} \right\rangle|^{2}, \quad \quad  m^{2}_{\tilde{q}_{\mbox{scalars}}} = |\lambda_{q}\left\langle \mathrm{S} \right\rangle|^{2} \pm |\lambda_{q}\left\langle \mathrm{F_{s}} \right\rangle |
\end{align}
By observing equation \ref{eq:MMass}, a general energy scale, $\mathbf{M}_{\mbox{mess}}$, for messenger particle's masses which is also an additional fundamental parameter in GMSB models can be defined as shown in equation \ref{eq:Mmess}.
\begin{equation}{\label{eq:Mmess}}
\mathbf{M}_{\mbox{mess}} = (\lambda_{q},\lambda_{\ell}) \left\langle \mathrm{S} \right\rangle 
\end{equation}

A common assumption in GMSB models according to~\cite{GMSB, SUSYBOOK} is that $\lambda_{q} \simeq \lambda_{\ell} \simeq \lambda $ and so $\mathbf{M}_{\mbox{mess}} = \lambda \left\langle \mathrm{S} \right\rangle$. However, in  Pure gauge mediated SUSY breaking models~(PGGM), $\lambda_{q} \neq \lambda_{\ell}$ \cite{PGGM}.
In the MSSM sector, gauginos and scalars obtained their mass through one-loop and two-loop level interactions respectively given according to equation \ref{eq:MSSMMasses}.
\begin{align}{\label{eq:MSSMMasses}}
\mathbf{M}_{a} &= \frac{\alpha_{a}}{4\pi}\mathrm{N_{5}}\mathbf{\Lambda} \\ 
\mathbf{m}^{2}_{\phi_{i}} &= 2\mathbf{\Lambda}^{2}\mathrm{N_{5}}\sum_{a=1}^{3}C_{a}(i) ( \frac{\alpha_{a}}{4\pi})^{2}
\end{align}
where $C_{a}(i)$ are constants of $\mathsf{O}(1)$, $\alpha_{a}$ are coupling constants and 
\begin{equation}{\label{eq:Lambda}}
\mathbf{\Lambda} = \frac{\mathbf{F}_{s}}{\lambda \left\langle \mathrm{S} \right\rangle } = \frac{\mathbf{F}_{s}}{\mathbf{M}_{\mbox{mess}}}
\end{equation} 
$\mathrm{N_{5}}$ is an additional parameter in GMSB models, specifying the number of messenger vector-like supermultiplets transforming under $SU(5)$. A motivation for $SU(5)$ is for the unification of gauge couplings at the GUT energy scale($M_{GUT} \approx 10^{16}$~GeV which is one of the major predictions of supersymmetry in unifying fundamental forces.
$\mathrm{N_{5}}$ is chosen to be not very large so as to avoid gauge couplings diverging before GUT scale. In the minimal GMSB models such as the SPS8 benchmark working point model $\mathrm{N_{5}} = 1$.
%A simple diagrams for these corrections can be seen in figure \ref{fig:figMass}.

%\end{figure}


On the other hand in PGGM models~(\cite{PGGM}), gauge and scalar particles have separate mass definitions~(eqn:\ref{eq:MPGGM}) since $\lambda_{q} \neq \lambda_{\ell}$.
\begin{align}{\label{eq:MPGGM}}
\mathbf{\Lambda}_{G} &= \frac{\mathrm{F}_{s}}{\lambda_{q} \left\langle \mathrm{S} \right\rangle } \\
\mathbf{\Lambda}_{S} &= \frac{\mathrm{F}_{s}}{\lambda_{\ell} \left\langle \mathrm{S} \right\rangle } 
\end{align}

$\mathbf{\Lambda}$ is the energy scale defining SUSY breaking at the MSSM level. It is known as the \textit{effective supersymmetry breaking scale} and determines the mass spectrum of gauginos and scalars in the MSSM.
$\mathbf{\Lambda}$ as defined in equation \ref{eq:Lambda} is considered to be a model parameter in GMSB models especially in minimal GMSB modles like the SPS8 bench mark model.

It is important to not that GGM models, \cite{GGM, GGM1, GGM2,MDINE1,MDINE2}, the mass of the gauginos $\mathbf{M}_{a}, a = 1,2,3$ defines the parameter space for these models.
Using equation \ref{eq:CGRAV}, the fundamental SUSY breaking scale $\mathbf{F}$ can be redefined in terms of the effective SUSY breaking scale $\mathbf{\Lambda}$  and the Messenger particle mass scale $\mathbf{M}_{\mbox{mess}}$:
\begin{align}{\label{eq:scale}}
\mathbf{F} = C_{grav}\cdot \mathbf{\Lambda}\cdot\mathbf{M}_{\mbox{mess}} 
\end{align}
and from equation \ref{eq:GMass}, the gravitino mass is re-written shown in equation \ref{eq:GMass2}
\begin{align}{\label{eq:GMass2}}
m_{\tilde{G}} & = C_{grav}\cdot \frac{\mathbf{\Lambda}\mathbf{M}_{\mbox{mess}}}{\sqrt{3}\mathrm{M}_{pl}}
\end{align}

In summary, the parameters $\mathbf{\Lambda}$, $\mathrm{N_{5}}$, and  $C_{grav}$  determines the phenomenology of GMSB models.The gravitino can become very light with its mass bounded only by cosmological observations and as such is identified as  the least stable supersymmetry particle~(LSP). By changing the value of $C_{grav}$, which is equivalent to scaling the induced supersymmetry breaking energy scale, allowing for weak interactions between the hidden sector and the messenger particles, the mass of the gravitino, $m_{\tilde{G}}$, is changed. This influences the decay rate and lifetime of the next-to-lightest supersymmetry particle~(NLSP) decaying to the gravitino which can vary from being an instantaneous or prompt decay to being a long-lived particle decay.


\paragraph{Phenomenology of GMSB Models}
\paragraph*{•}
The presence of light gravitinos and a unique gravitino-scalar-chiral fermion and gravitino-gaugino-gauge boson interactions as shown in figure \ref{fig:feynman_grav}  in GMSB models attract a lot interests in GMSB phenomenology as gravitino masses can be allowed to be as low as a few eV and only bounded by cosmological models making them an excellent candidate particle for Dark Matter~(DM).

\label{fig:feynman_grav}
\end{center}

 These light gravitinos with weak gravitino-gaugino or gravitino-scalar interactions allows for the decay of any next-to-lightest MSSM particle to a gravitino. This decay rate depends on the mass of the gravitino $m_{\tilde{G}}$ as long as R-parity is conserved. Thus, in the decay of every MSSM particle, the gravitino will likely or eventually be included in its final states. We can  parametrised this decay rate by using $C_{grav}$. It is easy to see that $C_{grav} \geq 1$. It is important to note that there are other GMSB phenomenological observations which do not entirely considered the gravitino as the lightest supersymmetric particle.
Thus in order to study the phenomenology of GMSB models, one can define a parameter space using the following parameters given in equation \ref{eq:mGMSB}. 
\begin{equation}{\label{eq:mGMSB}}
\left\{ \mathbf{\Lambda}, \quad \mathbf{M}_{\mbox{mess}},\quad \mathbf{N}_{5}, \quad \tan(\beta), \quad sgn(\mu),\quad C_{grav}\right\}
\end{equation}
Where the additional parameters  $\tan\beta$ and $sgn(\mu)$ are related to the two Higgs bosons necessary for supersymmetry breaking. $\tan\beta$ is the ratio of the vacuum expectations values for both Higgs bosons and $sgn(\mu)$ defines the sign of the Higgs potential.
These sets of parameters given in equation \ref{eq:mGMSB} are those we will be studying  within the minimal GMSB~(mGMSB). In the SPS8 benchmark model $\mathbf{M}_{\mbox{mess}} = 2\mathbf{\Lambda}$, $ \tan(\beta)=15$, $\mathbf{N}_{5}=1$, $\mathbf{\Lambda}$
and $C_{grav}$ are allowed to vary,\cite{SUSY}.
 In other gauge mediating supersymmetry models like the General Gauge Mediation SUSY breaking~(GGM), $\left\{M_{3}(\mbox{gluino mass}), M_{2}(\mbox{Wino mass}), M_{1}(\mbox{Bino mass}),\tan(\beta), sgn(\mu), c\tau_{NLSP}\right\}$
is the parameter space,\cite{GGM1,GGM2}.
In GGM models, colored sparticles are not required to be heavier than their Electro-Weak sparticles allowing for greater discovery potential at hadron collider\cite{DSHIH}. Thus, allowing for possibility of many candidates NLSP particles and not only the neutralino as in the case with mGMSB models like the SPS8 model.
For Pure General Gauge Mediation SUSY breaking~(PGGM), the parameter space is rather scan using $\displaystyle{\left\{\Lambda_{G},\Lambda_{S}, \mathrm{M}_{\mbox{mess}}\right\} }$ parameter set.
 
Of all other possible decay modes in GMSB models, this thesis is interested only in decays where eventually, the Next-To-Lightest SUSY particle~(NLSP) decays to the lightest SUSY particle~(LSP) which is the gravitino and its SM partner; i.e if particle, $\tilde{p}$ is the NLSP, then it will decay is given according to equation \ref{eq:NLSPDECAY}.
\begin{equation}{\label{eq:NLSPDECAY}}
\tilde{p}\rightarrow p + \tilde{G}
\end{equation}
In the SPS8 model, $\tilde{p}$ is the lightest neutralino~($\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}$). There are four types of neutralinos which are a mixture of the supersymmetric particles Bino~($\tilde{B}^{\circ}$),Wino~($\tilde{W}^{\circ}$), higgsino~($\tilde{H}^{\circ}_{u},\tilde{H}^{\circ}_{d}$), depending on the choice of parameters $M_{1},M_{2},M_{3}$, or $\Lambda$, $\tan\beta$, and $sgn(\mu)$.
While particle $p$ could be a photon~($\gamma$), Z boson~$(Z)$ (or $Z^{\prime}$) and a higgs boson~($h$).
This thesis, for experimental convenience, will focus on the parameter space for which the the particle $p$ is a photon~($\gamma$) and $C_{grav} > 1$.
This ensures that the lifetime of the NLSP is long enough such that its decay happens within the detector volume and the resulting photon is delayed or non-prompt on length scales of the detector.

The decay rate for a NLSP to its SM partner and a gravitino can be approximated as in equation \ref{eq:drate}(More details can be found in \cite{SM, GMSB, NLSP}).
\begin{equation}{\label{eq:drate}}
\Gamma(\tilde{NLSP} \rightarrow \gamma\tilde{G}) \approx  \frac{m^{5}_{\tilde{NLSP}}}{\mathbf{F}^{4}}
\end{equation}
This approximation is almost the same for the non-minimal GMSB models except that additional  parameters are present showing explicit dependence of the neutralino life time on neutralino mixing.
%It is important to observe here that, the decay rate is large for smaller values of the fundamental SUSY breaking scale or equivalently smaller gravitino mass for a fixed neutralino mass. Thus if $m_{NLSP}$ is of the $\mathrm{O}(100$~\GeV) or more and $\sqrt{\mathbf{F}} \ll 1000$~\TeV, meaning $m_{\tilde{G}} \leq 1$~\KeV, then the above decay rate is of the order than can be observed at hadron collider detectors.

\section{Long-Lived Particles in GMSB Models}
\paragraph*{}
In addition to mass, charge and spin being experimental handles use in the search for new physics, a particle's life time or decay length is a very relevant for discovering new fundamental interactions. Since through life time measurements, one has direct access to measuring and understanding and in some cases excluding the energy scale and fundamental parameters involved in a new interaction.
\subsection{Production of supersymmetric particles at Hadron Colliders}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Producing a supersymmetric particle at a hadron collider like the LHC is a probabilistic process. This process is quantitatively expressed as the production cross-section. The production cross-section expresses the probability of a given process happening. 
The mass of supersymmetric particles is much higher than those of SM particles and as a result, the cross-section for producing supersymmetric particles at a hadron collider is much smaller than that for SM particles.
%This probability depends on the distribution of type of incoming particles inside the colliding protons with enough proton energy fraction to create a supersymmetric particle. Since the mass of the supersymmetric particle being create depends on the available center of mass energy of the colliding partons. In a hadron collider like the LHC, gluons are the one of these partons with the highest probability of proton energy fraction distribution. Sea quarks such as up and down quarks which make up the proton as well as valence quark which can exist inside the proton provide their energy fraction is large enough can also collide to create SUSY particles. The figure \eqref{PDFs} show the parton distribution function against its energy fraction on the horizontal axis within a proton. The probability of creating a SUSY particle depends on the momentum transfer $Q$ of these partons.

The cross-section of a given process in supersymmetry~(SUSY) happening at the particle collider can be computed and compared with experimental measurements. The cross-section depends on the type of processes involved. Each process can be expressed in diagrammatic forms called \textit{feynman} diagrams and the probability of that process happening is computed using its represented feynman diagrams.

Supersymmetric processes that can lead to neutralino production and decay at a proton collider at the LHC can involve Electro-Weak and strong interactions. SUSY production through strong processes have larger cross-sections compared to Electro-Weak processes as can be shown in figure \ref{fig:SUSYPROD}.

\end{center}


Electro-Weak production of neutralinos through Electro-Weak interactions are known as \textit{direct} production of neutralinos while those due to strong interactions which is the dominant mode of supersymmetry production at the LHC, produce neutralinos through the production and decay of much heavier supersymmetric particles like squarks~($\tilde{q}$) and gluinos~($\tilde{g}$). This is referred to as \textit{indirect} or \textit{cascade decay} production of neutralinos. Examples of strong interaction processes include $pp \rightarrow \tilde{g}\tilde{g}$, $\tilde{q}\tilde{q}^{\star}$ and their feynman diagrams are shown in figure \ref{fig:feynman_gsDiag}. The produced squarks and gluinos do not decay directly into the gravitino but through a cascade decay process eventually decay to the gravitino through the neutralino. This is because, first, in R-parity conserving GMSB models, due to conservation of R-parity, SUSY particles are produced in pairs, and secondly because in GMSB models, as we saw in figure \ref{fig:feynman_grav}, they are no gravitino-gluino-gauge boson or gravitino-squark-gauge boson interactions but rather gravitino-gaugino-gauge boson or gravitino-scalar-chiral fermion interactions. Thus, the squark or gluino do not directly couple with the gravitino and so cannot directly decay into the gravitino but rather through a cascade decay.

\end{center}
The list of feynman diagrams presented for SUSY processes in figure \ref{fig:feynman_gsDiag} is not exhaustive. As previously mentioned, SUSY production cross-sections are very small compared to SM production processes. A production cross-section is express in term of a unit called a \textit{barns}~(b). ($1~b = 10^{-28}$~$m^{2}$). Because this number is quite small it is usually further express with suffix in front of the unit barn such as \textit{nano}~(n) or \textit{pico}~(p) or \textit{femto}~(f). The typical cross-section of producing a SUSY particle at the LHC is of the order of $1~pb =10^{-12}\times 10^{-28}~m^{2}$ or at times $1~fb = 10^{-15}\times 10^{-28}~cm^{2}$ for extremely rare SUSY processes. While a typical production of a standard model process such as the production of the $Z$ or $W$ bosons is of the order of a few $nb = 10^{-9}\times 10^{-28}~m^{2}$. Thus, finding a SUSY particle in an environment such as the LHC is very challenging, since most SUSY production cross-section are very small compared to an overwhelming high cross-section processes from the standard model.


%%%%%%%% DECAY %%%% LONG-LIVED%%%%%%%
\subsection{Decay of supersymmetric particles in CMS detector}
\paragraph{Neutralino as NLSP Decay Length}\mbox{}\\
The neutralinos produced from the cascade decay of squarks and gluinos can decay into a gravitino and a gauge boson or scalar particle. This decay is also a probabilistic process and can be expressed and quantified as a single real number. 
 There are always many options for a given particle to decay into and each of these options is quantified by a number known as the \textit{Branching  Fraction} or \textit{Branching Ratio}. Summing all the branching ratios for all the different decay processes gives the total \textit{Decay Width}. The total decay width, can also be computed and expressed as a single real number in units of \GeV or \MeV (\GeV = giga electron volt $=10^{9}$~eV). 
 %In the case of the neutralino as the NLSP, the decay width depends on the nature of its interaction with the gravitino and an associated gauge boson or scalar field.
\paragraph*{}
The probability for a neutralino~($\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}$), produced with an energy $\displaystyle{\mathrm{E}}$ having mass $m$ to travel a distance $x$ before decaying to a photon and gravitino in the laboratory frame is given as:
\begin{equation}{\label{eq:prop}}
\displaystyle{\mathcal{P}(x) = 1 - \exp{\left(- \frac{x}{\mathrm{L}} \right)} }
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}{\label{eq:dl}}
\displaystyle{\mathrm{L} = c\tau_{\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}}\cdot\left(\beta\gamma\right)_{\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}}}
\end{equation}

Equation \ref{eq:dl} gives the decay length of the neutralino particle as measured in the laboratory or a particle detector. This measured decay length depends on two major factors. First, The boost or $\beta = v/c$ which indicates the motion kinematics for a decaying particle. For slow moving particles which usually lead to large arrival time at the measuring detector, it is required that $\beta << 1$. These are known as slow moving particles. For the case of the neutralino, $\beta$ can be redefined as given in equation \ref{eq:beta}.
\begin{equation}{\label{eq:beta}}
\displaystyle{\left(\beta\gamma\right)_{\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}} = \frac{|p|}{m} = \sqrt{\left(\frac{E}{m}\right)^{2} - 1} }
\end{equation}
Equation \ref{eq:beta} shows that in order for the condition $\beta << 1$ to be true, one
would require that the momentum~(in this case transverse momentum, $\pt$) with which the neutralino is produced from gluino or squarks decays must be much smaller than the neutralino mass i.e  $m_{\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}}$. Thus, slow moving neutralino, whose ratio, $\pt{_{\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}}}/m_{\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}} << 1$  will be good candidates for detectable long-lived neutralinos.

Since mass of SUSY particles like gluino, squarks and also neutralino is kept fixed by the SUSY effective breaking scale $\mathbf{\Lambda}$ as shown in equations \ref{eq:MSSMMasses}, the neutralino $\pt$ will depend o the number of associated quarks observed as \textit{jets} produced during the gluino or squark decay. Gluino or squark decays with very low jet multiplicity will lead to the production of large $\pt$ neutralinos which eventually leads to more boost factor while high jet multiplicity will lead to low $\pt$ neutralinos and hence low boost or $\beta$ factor. It is important to note that in either case, this depends also on the measured $\pt$ of the jets whether is low or high jet multiplicity cases. It is also worth mentioning that the photon produced from neutralino decay can also be arrived with large delayed time in situations where the photon arrival path to the detector is not a direct straight path but rather deviated as a result of a highly boosted neutralino produced from gluino or squark decay.
\newline
In addition to the boost factor, the inherent proper decay length, $c\tau$,  will also determine the extend to which a long-lived neutralino is detectable at a particle detector. Neutralino with very long lifetime, $c\tau$, beyond the detectable length of the particle detector will obviously travel out of the detector before decay and as a result are often not detectable while neutralinos with very short lifetime may also be undetectable  as their decay length travel is not enough to be able to separate them for background events in a detector environment like the LHC unless other methods are employed like using its impact parameter distance travelled. However, this is only applicable in scenarios where the neutralino decays into a charged particle with tracks in the detector such that its decay production vertex can be used to correctly calculate and extracts the neutralino impact parameter or in other sophisticated detectors which the direction of the particle from neutralino decay is accessible. This the is case with ATLAS particle detector and not so with CMS detector.
One can always estimated the neutralino proper decay from theory using equations like the one given in equation \ref{eq:ctau}. 

\begin{equation}{\label{eq:ctau}}
c\tau_{\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}} \approx \left(\frac{m_{\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}}}{\mbox{ GeV}}\right)^{-5}\left(\frac{\sqrt{\mathbf{F}}}{\mbox{TeV}}\right)^{4}
\end{equation}
It is important to observe here that, varying $\mathbf{F}$ changes the lifetime of the neutralino. This variation can be easily be performed in GMSB models using the parameter $C_{grav}$. Equation \ref{eq:ctau} now becomes equation \ref{eq:pdlength}  which is the equation used to simulate and produce simulated samples~(Monte Carlo) of neutralino production and decay when studying neutralino properties in a particle detector. 
\begin{equation}{\label{eq:pdlength}}
c\tau_{\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}} \approx C^{2}_{grav} \left(\frac{m_{\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}}}{\mbox{GeV}}\right)^{-5}\left(\frac{\sqrt{\mathbf{F}_{s}}}{\mbox{TeV}}\right)^{4}
\end{equation}

%With $C_{grav}$, one could  one could change the decay length of the NLSP such that its decay occurs within the volume of the detector such that the resulting photon is delayed. This gives a unique signature for discovering SUSY in hadron colliders as photons produced from SM interactions are prompt.
Using the LHC as the proton-proton collider and the CMS detector as the instrument for detecting and measuring the lifetime of delayed photons produced from long-lived neutralino decays. We have simulated neutralino production and decay according to the mGMSB SPS8 benchmark model, where the neutralino is the NLSP decaying into a photon and the gravitino as LSP. Figure \ref{fig:NKINE} shows some kinematic properties and the neutralino proper decay length distribution and the delayed photon in different  SUSY parameter choices. The CMS Software~(CMSSW) packaged is used to simulate and study the neutralino production and decay in CMS detector while using root data analysis framework, we also performed some fit analysis on the generated and simulated decay length distribution to extract its proper decay length as produced during the MC generation and compare this to theoretical expectations to check for consistency. Our choice of parton distribution function is CTEQ6L1 with LHAPDF for producing GSMB MC samples from SLHA files. Most studies are performed by varying $\mathbf{\Lambda}$ and $C_{grav}$ or the neutralino proper decay length, $c\tau$. The results are expressed in a two dimensional $\mathbf{\Lambda}$ or $m_{\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}}$ against $c\tau$ for a particular model.

%\subsection{Why is the search for neutral long-lived particles important?}
%\paragraph*{}
% Finding answers to fundamental questions such as the following: What is the origin of neutrino masses, Why are there only 3 types of leptons and quarks? Where do all the parameters in SM come from? Other big questions include: What is Dark Matter ~(DM)? is DM made of particles? Can one detect these particles? Why is there so much asymmetry between matter and anti-matter in our universe? Is there some energy scale or early epoch in the evolution of the universe where all the fundamental forces behaved as a unique kind of force. Do baryons such as the proton exist forever? What is the lifetime of the proton? What is Dark Energy~(DE)? Is the Universe expanding indefinitely? Are there other Universes? 
% provide added impetus to search for particles BSM. We believe that the discovery of a long-live particle which are not known to exist within the current SM will provide unique access to understanding physics BSM and making measurements which can provide answers to most of the above questions.
%\newline{}
%These questions have been addressed in two major fronts: Theoretically which involves lots of model building and Experimentally which can be divided into Observational as well as Collider Experiments. Most of these experiments involves the search for w new physics phenomenon. In this Thesis, we have decided to address some of these questions by searching for New Physics phenomenon or New Particles ~(NP) in a Hadron Collider experiment. 
%As a consequence, there are many searches for New Particles or New Physics~(NP) 
%Searching for LL neutral particles decaying to photon using timing gives us a unique advantage compared to other experiments as we expect very limited background process contribution from SM. Most of our background will be detector originated contributions
%Infact, we are searching for some NP which have been predicted to exist in nature by many Theoretical extensions of the SM collectively referred to as Beyond the Standard Model~(BSM). We will describe one of such models in the next section below.
%We are interested in searching for neutral NP through their lifetime. 
%Infact, our search using lifetime gives us a wide range of search techniques  depending on the lifetime of the LL particle ranging from quantitative measurements to statistics. The figure below  shows the wide variety of techniques which can be used to search for LL particles in general.
%\begin{equation}
%\mbox{ADD figure of techniques for Searches using LL}
%\end{equation}
%\begin{figure}
%\centering
%\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{}
%\caption{Different techniques to Search for LL particles.}
%\end{figure}
%Using equations \eqref{ctau}, precise measurement of fundamental parameters in SUSY or new physics can be archived.
%Another advantage is that, the our search for neutral particles  is unique in that a lot of previous searches been performed for charged particles but very limited for neutral LL particles since DM is speculated to be made of stable neutral particle(s) with long lifetime, we might as well go for DM. 
%We also use lifetime because no particle with lifetime $\gtrsim10^{-7}$~s and mass $\gtrsim 1.5$~GeV has been found and obviously because our detector has a very good timing resolution as can be seen in the section of the CMS detector in this thesis.
%\newline{}
%There have been previous attempts to search for quasi-stable neutral massive particles but all the search results show no evidence for neutral particles with long lifetime.  
%or neutral particles in general or neutral hadrons in particular 
%The challenge with such an experiment is that neutral particles cannot be studied using conventional magnetic spectrometer as they are not affected by magnetic field because they are charge~(local 
%U(1) gauge symmetry) neutral.
%Nevertheless, there are countless theoretical as well as observational reasons why studying these particles using novel experimental techniques is very important in the field of particle physics. 
%Some of these reasons will emerge naturally as we see in the subsequent sections below.
%We will attempt to give our humble lists of reasons in the following
%sections why we believe it is fundamental to study these particles.
%\subsubsection{Theory Motivation.}
%Physics BSM can be summarized to answering three major theoretical questions:  Is there a reliable explanation  
%behind the ordering in mass of SM particles as observed? This is the Hierarchy problem.
%Is there a single theory which can provide a derivation for all the 
%numerous parameters (19) in the SM and also unify all the fundamental forces of nature? Grand Unified Theories (GUT). 
%What is DM and Dark Energy (DE)?
%(DE is the stuff that is responsible for the accelerated expansion of our universe).
%And finally being a particle physicist it is only natural to ask if DM is made up of particles and if yes,
%Can one construct a model which can consistently describe DM as is already the case with visible matter in SM?
%\newline
%Most of the efforts in the last decades in theoretical particle physics has been to find answers to the above questions.
%\subsubsection{Experiment and Observation Motivation }
%As early as 1956 Reines and Cowan\cite{Neutrino} observed that when a neutron decays into a proton and an electron, an elusive particle called neutrino is also produced. The observation of neutrinos was later incorporated into the SM. In the formulation of the SM, the neutrinos are considered massless.
%However, recent results from experiments \cite{NeutrinoMix} have shown that neutrinos of different flavours can oscillate or mix into one another. The only way they can do this is if they have a tiny but finite mass. Recent experiments measuring the different neutrino flavours and their mass difference point towards the existence of a much larger theory that can incorporate the existence of neutrino masses and the observed phenomenon of neutrino mixing in which the SM is embedded in it   and can be understood as a low energy version of a much broader and deeper theory.
%\paragraph*{}
%Galactic and supernovae observations using the Hubble and a host of other telescope as well as results from Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation~(BAO) and WMAP reveal unique matter content of our universe. In addition to these cosmological observations including galaxy profiles,cluster formation, large scale structure formation and Cosmic Microwave background~(CMB) power spectrum can be somehow explained by DM \cite{WMAP}. These observation reveals about 25\% of our universe is made of DM with the current DM relic density is measured to be  %${\POmega}_{DM}h^{2} = {0.105} ^{\p 0.021}_{\m 0.030}$
%However, the question of "What is DM?" remains a very interesting one to both the particle physics astronomy society.
%Understanding DM and the rest of our universe will be crucial for future developments in high energy physics from both theory and experimental fronts.  
%A possible property of DM is that they must be made of up long lived neutral particles. There are candidate particles from SUSY which have these properties. A few of these include lightest neutralino~(\PSneutralinoOne) and gravitino~($\tilde{G}$). From the GMSB point of view, because gravitinos are stable, neutral and very weakly interacting; they are seen as good candidates for the particles which make up DM. 
%\subsubsection{Current Experimental Limits}
%Past Experiments seems to indicate that the remaining un %searched phase space for possible existence of SUSY particles %in shrinking.

% The SM of particle physics in all its glory is the most precise and well developed model describing and providing our understanding of how energy, space and time interact with each other.

\section{Previous Search Experiments and Results}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The hunt for the discovery of DM and new particles, has led to several experimental search  for neutral long-live particles decaying to photons. Obviously, negative results from these experiments has led to the putting limits of the lifetime, mass and cross section of possible existence of SUSY particles in different models of SUSY. Results from experiments(DO, CDF, CMS and ATLAS)\cite{LEP,CDF,ATLAS, CMSD, ATLAS1} in the search for Neutralino NLSP decaying to photon and gravitino  and interpreted within the SPS8 benchmark model with choice of parameters as seen in \ref{fig:UpperLimits}. These results show that within the SPS8 model, neutralinos with mass $m_{\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}} \leq 245$~\GeV and proper decay length $c\tau_{\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}} \leq 6000$~mm cannot exist at hadron colliders and thus their existence has been excluded.
