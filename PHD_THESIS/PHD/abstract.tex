We perform a search for events with delayed photons and large missing transverse momentum from the decay of long-lived neutral particles produced in LHC proton-proton collisions with a center-of-mass energy, $\sqrt{S} = 8$\TeV. Capitalizing on the excellent timing resolution of the CMS Electromagnetic Calorimeter, the search uses as the only search quantity timing measurements made by the Electromagnetic Calorimeter of the photon. We observed a single event, consistent with our background expectations from the Standard Model and proceed to set exclusion limits on the mass of the lightest neutralino or effective Supersymmetry breaking energy scale and lifetime of the lightest neutralino. The limits interpreted in the context of the SPS8 benchmark GBSM model show that light neutralinos with mass, $m_{\PSneutralinoOne} \leq 300$\GeVcc, or effective Supersymmetry breaking energy scale, $\mathbf{\Lambda} \leq 220\TeV$, and mean lifetime, $\tau_{\PSneutralinoOne} \leq 45$~ns, are ruled out of existence at 95\% Confidence Limit~(CL) computed using the $CL_{s}$ method. The exclusion limit on the production cross section times branching ratio of the lightest neutralino to photon and gravitino decay channel,  $\sigma_{(\PSneutralinoOne \rightarrow \gamma + \tilde{G})}\times BR$, for lightest neutralino with different lifetimes and masses is also provided. We show, for the first time, that using only timing measurements from the CMS Electromagnetic Calorimeter provides good sensitivity to search for lightest neutralinos with lifetime up to $40$~ns and masses up to $300$\GeVcc. A discussion of the Electromagnetic Calorimeter timing  measurement and performance is also presented.

%We provide possible improvements  of our search analysis which might help discover delayed photons in future.%Dark matter particles are believed to be neutral, stable, weakly interacting with ordinary matter and maybe massive. The hunt for dark matter particles is on! There are theoretical models which predict the  existence of dark matter particles that can be produced in a proton-proton collider like the Large Hadron Collider provided there is sufficient center of mass energy. Gauge Mediating Supersymmetric Models are examples of such models. These models describe the production and decay into isolated energetic photons, new, massive, neutral, weakly interacting particles known as supersymmetric particles. The Neutralino~($\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}$), being the lightest supersymmetric particle in terms of mass, is a prime example and its decay into a photon is accompanied by a light weakly interacting and stable supersymmetric particle, the gravitino~($\tilde{G}$) which is considered to be a very good candidate for dark matter particles. The resulting photon from such a decay, is understood to be delayed in its arrival time at the detector. This timing delay is due to inherent dynamics understood and well described by models beyond the standard model. The signature of a delayed photon is not specific to only supersymmetric models but could be the result of probably some new kind of physics unrelated to the standard model.
